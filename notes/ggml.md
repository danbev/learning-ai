## GGML
"GG" refers to the initials of its originator (Georgi Gerganov) and I think
ML is just for machine learning. It is a tensor library for machine learning
written in C/C++.

> **Note on Updates**
> While I try to stay up to date with the development in GGML, it is challenging due to the rapid development. I will try to keep this document up to date but some things will become out of date until I have time to revisit them.

The code examples can be found in [ggml](../fundamentals/ggml/README.md) and
are updated more frequently (at least as often as I update the ggml submodule).

### Introduction
For me it helps to draw parallels between GGML and part1 of [zero-to-hero],
where we created a Value struct which in addition of holding a value, would also
have a gradient, an operation, and children if the value was created by an
operation. The Value struct also supported automatic differentiation. In a
simliar manner GGML has a `tensor` struct which holds a value, ~~a gradient~~, an
operation and a `src` array which is simlar to the children in zero-to-hero
in that is would contain the left hand side and right hand side of an operation.

_NOTE_: The `grad` field was recently removed and I hope to revisit this and
understand how it works now.

In the case of zero-to-hero when we perform an operation on a Value the
operation itself will create a new Value which will contain the output of the
operation, and it will also "connect" this with the left and right operands.
This will form a graph of Values which we can then at some point backpropagate
through. In GGML the graph is created upfront before the actual operation is
performed. 

The tensor struct also supports ability to generate dot draphs. GGML contains
more than that, but the tensor is one of the the basic structure.

GGML model files contain binary-encoded data, including version number,
hyperparameters, vocabulary, and weights.

So GGML is used by llama.cpp, and whisper.cpp. In addition GGML is what is the
used by the Rust `llm` crate, and also by llm-chain. So learning about GGML will
help understand all of these project better.

### Memory usage
We start off by specifying the memory that GGML will use. This is done by
creating a `struct ggml_init_params` and passing it to the `ggml_init`:
```c 
  struct ggml_init_params params = {
    .mem_size   = 16*1024*1024, // 16 MB
    .mem_buffer = NULL,
    .no_alloc   = false,
  };
  struct ggml_context* ctx = ggml_init(params);
```
So in this case we will have 16 MB of memory available for GGML to use.
For this example I'm using [graph.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/graph.c) and
the next thing it does is it creates a graph:
```c
  struct ggml_cgraph* c_graph = ggml_new_graph(ctx);
```
This call will end up in:
```c
struct ggml_cgraph * ggml_new_graph(struct ggml_context * ctx) {
    return ggml_new_graph_custom(ctx, GGML_DEFAULT_GRAPH_SIZE, false);
}
```
The GGML_DEFAULT_GRAPH_SIZE is 2048, and `false` is for the `grad` parameter in
that gradients should not be computed.

Next the size of the object will be computed
```c
struct ggml_cgraph * ggml_new_graph_custom(struct ggml_context * ctx, size_t size, bool grads) {
    const size_t obj_size = ggml_graph_nbytes(size, grads);
```
```console
(gdb) p obj_size
$3 = 65640 
```

```c
struct ggml_object * obj = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_GRAPH, obj_size);

    enum ggml_object_type {
        GGML_OBJECT_TENSOR,
        GGML_OBJECT_GRAPH,
        GGML_OBJECT_WORK_BUFFER
    };
```
So we can see that 3 objects types are currently supported.

```c
static struct ggml_object * ggml_new_object(struct ggml_context* ctx,
    enum ggml_object_type type, size_t size) {
    // always insert objects at the end of the context's memory pool
    struct ggml_object * obj_cur = ctx->objects_end;

    const size_t cur_offs = obj_cur == NULL ? 0 : obj_cur->offs;
    const size_t cur_size = obj_cur == NULL ? 0 : obj_cur->size;
    const size_t cur_end  = cur_offs + cur_size;

    // align to GGML_MEM_ALIGN
    size_t size_needed = GGML_PAD(size, GGML_MEM_ALIGN);

    char * const mem_buffer = ctx->mem_buffer;
    struct ggml_object * const obj_new = (struct ggml_object *)(mem_buffer + cur_end);
```
This is the first thing to be added to the memory that was allocated in the
`ggml_init` call. So this is creating a pointer to a `ggml_object` which will be
the first thing in the memory area that was allocated. 

So what is a `ggml_object`?  
It is defined as:
```c
struct ggml_object {
    size_t offs;
    size_t size;
    struct ggml_object * next;
    enum ggml_object_type type;
    char padding[4];
};
```
I think the `offs` is the offset into `mem_buffer`, and size is the size of that
memory.

To get a visual of this perhaps we can think about the memory as the following
initially: 
```
    mem_buffer
       ↓
       +---------------------------------------------------------
       |                                                      ... 
       +---------------------------------------------------------
```
Then we dedicate a portion of this memory area to an `ggml_object`:
```
    mem_buffer + cur_end
       ↓
       +---------------------------------------------------------
       | ggml_object          |                               ... 
       +---------------------------------------------------------
       ↑
     obj_new
```
And this memory is then updated:
```c
    *obj_new = (struct ggml_object) {
        .offs = cur_end + GGML_OBJECT_SIZE,
        .size = size_needed,
        .next = NULL,
        .type = type,
    };
```
And just to verify this:
```console
(gdb) p *(struct ggml_object*) mem_buffer
$10 = {offs = 32, size = 65648, next = 0x0, type = GGML_OBJECT_GRAPH, padding = "\000\000\000"}
(gdb) p sizeof(struct ggml_object)
$11 = 32
```
Next, if the current object is not null (which is not the case currently in
this debugging session) we will update the next pointer of the current object
to point to the new object.
```c
    if (obj_cur != NULL) {
        obj_cur->next = obj_new;
    } else {
        // this is the first object in this context
        ctx->objects_begin = obj_new;
    }

    ctx->objects_end = obj_new;
```
And on the last line above we update the context `objects_end` to point to the
newly created object. So now our memory looks like this:
```
    mem_buffer
       ↓
       +---------------------------------------------------------
       | ggml_object          |                               ... 
       +---------------------------------------------------------
       ↑
     obj_new
       ↑
     ctx->objects_end
```
After this the pointer to the new object is returned.

Just to recap where we were:
```console
(gdb) bt
#0  ggml_new_object (ctx=0x7ffff7fba008 <g_state+8>, type=GGML_OBJECT_GRAPH, size=65640)
    at /home/danielbevenius/work/ai/learning-ai/fundamentals/ggml/ggml/src/ggml.c:2446
#1  0x00007ffff7ec0cee in ggml_new_graph_custom (ctx=0x7ffff7fba008 <g_state+8>, size=2048, grads=false)
    at /home/danielbevenius/work/ai/learning-ai/fundamentals/ggml/ggml/src/ggml.c:15635
#2  0x00007ffff7ec0ed0 in ggml_new_graph (ctx=0x7ffff7fba008 <g_state+8>)
    at /home/danielbevenius/work/ai/learning-ai/fundamentals/ggml/ggml/src/ggml.c:15670
#3  0x00000000004012d0 in main (argc=1, argv=0x7fffffffd0b8) at src/graph.c:19
```
So we were in `ggml_new_graph_custom`:
```c
    struct ggml_object * obj = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_GRAPH, obj_size);
    struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph = (struct ggml_cgraph *) ((char *) ctx->mem_buffer + obj->offs);
```
So we created an obj and this and `ctx->mem_buffer` currently point to the same
location:
```console
(gdb) p ctx->mem_buffer
$18 = (void *) 0x7ffff6ba0010
(gdb) p obj
$19 = (struct ggml_object *) 0x7ffff6ba0010
(gdb) p obj->offs
$13 = 32
```
And now we are creating a pointer to a `ggml_cgraph` (compute graph) which is
pointing to `mem_buffer + 32`. So we have the obj which is currently pointing to
`mem_buffer` because this is the first object created, and every object as data
as in `ggml_object` which we can sort of think of as a base struct. And then
after the base struct we can have different "subtypes". In the above case we are
saying that we memory area after the `obj->off` is going to store a `ggml_cgraph`
struct.
```
    mem_buffer
       ↓
       +---------------------------------------------------------
       | ggml_object     |ggml_cgraph |                       ... 
       +---------------------------------------------------------
       ↑                 ↑
     obj_new            off
       ↑
     ctx->objects_end
```
The `ggml_cgraph` struct is defined as:
```console
(gdb) ptype struct ggml_cgraph
type = struct ggml_cgraph {
    int size;
    int n_nodes;
    int n_leafs;
    struct ggml_tensor** nodes;
    struct ggml_tensor** grads;
    struct ggml_tensor** leafs;
    struct ggml_hash_set visited_hash_table;
    enum ggml_cgraph_eval_order order;
    int perf_runs;
    int64_t perf_cycles;
    int64_t perf_time_us;
}

(gdb) p *cgraph
$28 = {size = 0, n_nodes = 0, n_leafs = 0, nodes = 0x0, grads = 0x0, leafs = 0x0, visited_hash_table = {size = 0, 
    keys = 0x0}, order = GGML_CGRAPH_EVAL_ORDER_LEFT_TO_RIGHT, perf_runs = 0, perf_cycles = 0, perf_time_us = 0}
```
Next, we have:
```c
    struct ggml_tensor** data_start = (struct ggml_tensor **) (cgraph + 1);
```
This is creating a pointer to a pointer to a `ggml_tensor` and the location will
be cgraph + 80 because the size of the `ggml_cgraph` is 80 bytes:
```console
(gdb) p sizeof(struct ggml_cgraph)
$30 = 80
(gdb) p cgraph 
$31 = (struct ggml_cgraph *) 0x7ffff6ba0030
(gdb) p cgraph + 1
$32 = (struct ggml_cgraph *) 0x7ffff6ba0080
(gdb) p 0x7ffff6ba0080 - 0x7ffff6ba0030
$33 = 80
```
So this will be a pointer to the end of the `cgraph` struct in memory.
```c
    size_t hash_size = ggml_hash_size(size * 2);
    struct ggml_tensor** nodes_ptr = data_start;

    struct ggml_tensor** leafs_ptr = nodes_ptr + size;

    struct ggml_tensor** hash_keys_ptr = leafs_ptr + size;

    struct ggml_tensor** grads_ptr = grads ? hash_keys_ptr + hash_size : NULL;
```
`hash_size` will be:
```
15640	    size_t hash_size = ggml_hash_size(size * 2);
Value returned is $36 = 4099
```
Next we can see that `nodes_ptr` will point to the same location as
`data_start`. Next, `leafs_ptr` will be set to point to `nodes_ptr + size` which
is:
```console
(gdb) p sizeof(struct ggml_tensor**)
$45 = 8
(gdb) p size * 8
$46 = 16384

(gdb) p leafs_ptr 
$48 = (struct ggml_tensor **) 0x7ffff6ba4080
(gdb) p notes_ptr
No symbol "notes_ptr" in current context.
(gdb) p nodes_ptr
$49 = (struct ggml_tensor **) 0x7ffff6ba0080
(gdb) p 0x7ffff6ba4080 - 0x7ffff6ba0080
$50 = 16384
```
So, that is it will point to the memory after all the `nodes_ptrs`.
And something similar will happen for `hash_keys_ptr` and `grads_ptr` (unless
grads is null).

Next the hash keys will be zeroed out:
```c
    memset(hash_keys_ptr, 0, hash_size * sizeof(struct ggml_tensor *));
```
And then the cgraph will be initialized and returned:
```c
    *cgraph = (struct ggml_cgraph) {
        /*.size         =*/ size,
        /*.n_nodes      =*/ 0,
        /*.n_leafs      =*/ 0,
        /*.nodes        =*/ nodes_ptr,
        /*.grads        =*/ grads_ptr,
        /*.leafs        =*/ leafs_ptr,
        /*.hash_table   =*/ { hash_size, hash_keys_ptr },
        /*.order        =*/ GGML_CGRAPH_EVAL_ORDER_LEFT_TO_RIGHT,
        /*.perf_runs    =*/ 0,
        /*.perf_cycles  =*/ 0,
        /*.perf_time_us =*/ 0,
    };

    return cgraph;
```
That will return us back in our program graph.c.

Now, lets take a look at how a <span id="tensor_mem">tensor</span>
tensor is represented in memory:
```c
  struct ggml_tensor* a = ggml_new_tensor_1d(ctx, GGML_TYPE_F32, 1);
```
```console
(gdb) l
2566	struct ggml_tensor * ggml_new_tensor_1d(
2567	        struct ggml_context* ctx,
2568	        enum ggml_type type,
2569	        int64_t ne0) {
2570	    return ggml_new_tensor(ctx, type, 1, &ne0);
2571	}
```
`ne0` is the number of elements in the first dimension. 
```console
(gdb) l
2558	struct ggml_tensor * ggml_new_tensor(
2559	        struct ggml_context * ctx,
2560	        enum   ggml_type      type,
2561	        int                   n_dims,
2562	        const int64_t       * ne) {
2563	    return ggml_new_tensor_impl(ctx, type, n_dims, ne, NULL, 0);
2564	}

(gdb) l
2461	
2462	static struct ggml_tensor * ggml_new_tensor_impl(
2463	        struct ggml_context* ctx,
2464	        enum ggml_type type,
2465	        int n_dims,
2466	        const int64_t* ne,
2467	        struct ggml_tensor* view_src,
2468	        size_t view_offs) {
```
Notice that the last two arguments are NULL and 0 which are the `view_src` and
`view_offs`.
Skipping some things about views which I'm not familiar with yet and also
skipping the scratch buffer.
TODO: take a closer look at views and scratch buffers.

Next, we have something that might now look familar:
```c
    struct ggml_object * const obj_new = ggml_new_object(ctx,
        GGML_OBJECT_TENSOR,
        GGML_TENSOR_SIZE + obj_alloc_size);
```
But this time instead of a `GGML_OBJECT_GRAPH` we are creating a
`GGML_OBJECT_TENSOR`.
```console
(gdb) p sizeof(struct ggml_tensor)
$60 = 384
(gdb) p obj_alloc_size
$61 = 4
(gdb) p sizeof(struct ggml_tensor) + obj_alloc_size
$62 = 388
```

### GGML walk through

```console
$ gdb --args ./llama-cli -m models/llama-2-13b-chat.Q4_0.gguf --prompt "What is LoRA?</s>"
(gdb) br
Breakpoint 2 at 0x429ea4: file ggml.c, line 4589.

(gdb) bt
#0  ggml_init (params=...) at ggml.c:4589
#1  0x00000000004802b5 in llama_backend_init (numa=false) at llama.cpp:6623
#2  0x000000000040b235 in main (argc=5, argv=0x7fffffffd1c8) at examples/main/main.cpp:171

(gdb) p ggml_init
$25 = {struct ggml_context *(struct ggml_init_params)} 0x429d89 <ggml_init>
```
So the function `ggml_init` returns an instance of `struct ggml_context`
initialized with the parameters. The `struct ggml_context` is an opaque struct
so we can't simply use `ptype ggml_context` to see what it contains. But we can
list it using:
```console
(gdb) list ggml.c:4188
4183	
4184	//
4185	// ggml context
4186	//
4187	
4188	struct ggml_context {
4189	    size_t mem_size;
4190	    void * mem_buffer;
4191	    bool   mem_buffer_owned;
4192	    bool   no_alloc;
(gdb) 
4193	    bool   no_alloc_save; // this is used to save the no_alloc state when using scratch buffers
4194	
4195	    int    n_objects;
4196	
4197	    struct ggml_object * objects_begin;
4198	    struct ggml_object * objects_end;
4199	
4200	    struct ggml_scratch scratch;
4201	    struct ggml_scratch scratch_save;
4202	};
```

Turning our attention back to the `ggml_init` function we can see that it
has the following initialization of some tables:
```console
gdb) l
4579	        // initialize GELU, Quick GELU, SILU and EXP F32 tables
4580	        {
4581	            const uint64_t t_start = ggml_time_us(); UNUSED(t_start);
4582	
4583	            ggml_fp16_t ii;
4584	            for (int i = 0; i < (1 << 16); ++i) {
4585	                uint16_t ui = i;
4586	                memcpy(&ii, &ui, sizeof(ii));
4587	                const float f = table_f32_f16[i] = GGML_COMPUTE_FP16_TO_FP32(ii);
4588	                table_gelu_f16[i] = GGML_FP32_TO_FP16(ggml_gelu_f32(f));
4589	                table_gelu_quick_f16[i] = GGML_FP32_TO_FP16(ggml_gelu_quick_f32(f));
4590	                table_silu_f16[i] = GGML_FP32_TO_FP16(ggml_silu_f32(f));
4591	                table_exp_f16[i]  = GGML_FP32_TO_FP16(expf(f));
4592	            }
```
So lets take a closer look at what is going on here. First we have the `ii`
variable which is of type `ggml_fp16_t` which is defined as:
```c
typedef uint16_t ggml_fp16_t;
```
On my machine this is an unsiged 16 bit integer.
```console
(gdb) ptype ii
type = unsigned short
(gdb) p sizeof(ii)
$11 = 2 (bytes)
```
So this is a 16 bit unsigned integer, that is 2 bytes and the range is 0 to
65535.
Next we have a look which will iterate over 65536 elements:
```console
(gdb) p/d (1 << 16)
$8 = 65536
(gdb) p/t (1 << 16)
$7 = 10000000000000000
```
The first thing that happens in the loop is that the integer i, note that this
is a 32 bit integer (4 bytes), is copied into the 16 bit unsigned integer ui.
```
0000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 = 65536
                    0000 0000 0000 0000 = 0
```
Notice that we are discarding the upper 16 bits of the 32 bit integer. And
recall that our loop only iterates 65536 times. So the value of ui will be
0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 65535. Next we have the memcpy:
```console
4586	                memcpy(&ii, &ui, sizeof(ii));
```
The usage of `memcpy` was not obvious to me at first and I thought that after
looking at the actual types used a simple assignment would be sufficient:
```c
    ii = (ggml_fp16_t)ui;  // Implicit conversion
```
But `memcpy` is used instead to safely copy bits from the `uint16_t` variable
`ui` to the `ggml_fp16_t` variable `ii` without relying on implicit type
conversion which might not behave as desired, especially if `ggml_fp16_t` and
`uint16_t` have different internal representations. `memcpy` ensures abit-wise
copy, preserving the exact bit pattern from `ui` to `ii` over the specified
number of bytes (`sizeof(ii)`), which is crucial when dealing with different
data types or when precise control over memory is required.

Next we have the following line:
```console
4587  const float f = table_f32_f16[i] = GGML_COMPUTE_FP16_TO_FP32(ii);
```
This is a compound assignment and is equivalent to:
```c
    table_f32_f16[i] = GGML_COMPUTE_FP16_TO_FP32(ii);
    const float f = table_f32_f16[i];
```
So 16-bit floats, or half-floats are popular for storing data in memory but
computations are typically done using 32-bit floats. The macro
`GGML_COMPUTE_FP16_TO_FP32` is used to convert the 16-bit float to a 32-bit
float. The macro is defined as:
```c
#define GGML_COMPUTE_FP16_TO_FP32(x) _cvtsh_ss(x)                               
```
Notice that this uses an intrinsic function `_cvtsh_ss`, so it is implemented
by some low-level code that can directly use special hardware operations to
convert the 16-bit float to a 32-bit float. Alright, so we now understand that
we are storing values as 16-bit floats in memory but we are converting them to
32-bit floats when we need to do computations.

The table `table_f32_f16` is an array and contains all possible 16-bit values
(from 0 to 65535), which cover all possible half-precision floating-point
numbers.
```
static float table_f32_f16[65536];
```
And we are poplulating this array with the values of the
`GGML_COMPUTE_FP16_TO_FP32` macro above which will be single-precision floating
point values which are 32-bits. Later when we need to do computations we can
just cast a ggml_fp16_t value to an unsigned short and use that as an index
to get the single-precision 32-bit value without having to do any conversions.

So if we have a value of type
`ggml_fp16_t` we should be able to look that up in the table. After four
iterations the table will look like this (only showing the first 5 elements):
```console
(gdb) p table_f32_f16[0]
$43 = 0

(gdb) p table_f32_f16[1]
$44 = 5.96046448e-08

(gdb) p table_f32_f16[2]
$45 = 1.1920929e-07

(gdb) p table_f32_f16[3]
$46 = 1.78813934e-07

(gdb) p table_f32_f16[4]
$47 = 0
```
If we take a look at the second element it is 5.96046448e-08, which is the
smallest positive value that can be represented by a 32-bit float.

```console
(gdb) x table_f32_f16 
0x6011e0 <table_f32_f16>:	00000000000000000000000000000000

(gdb) p table_f32_f16[1]
$69 = 5.96046448e-08
(gdb) x/w table_f32_f16 +  1
0x6011e4 <table_f32_f16+4>:	00110011100000000000000000000000
```
Lets take the entry of index 1. We have a 32-bit float, which is 4 bytes:
```
   0011 0011 1000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
   0 01100111 000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
   ↑    ↑      ↑   ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑
   S=0  E= 103   M= 00000000000000000000000

S = sign bit
E = exponent, 8 bits
M = mantissa, 23 bits

(-1)ˢ × 2ᴱ⁻¹⁵⁷ × 1.F

(-1)⁰ × 2¹⁰³⁻¹²⁷ × 1.00000000000000000000000
= 2¹⁰³⁻¹²⁷
= 2⁻²⁴
= 5.96046448e-08
```

```
gdb) p table_f32_f16[2]
$70 = 1.1920929e-07
```
First we write 1.92e-07 in m x 2^e format:
```
1.1920929 × 10^−7 = 1.0101010100 ×2^−23
```
In IEEE 754 single-precision, an exponent bias of 127 is used, so the stored
exponent value is −23 + 127 = 104, or 01101000 in binary.
Recall that the exponent field is 8 bits, so we can have values between 0 and
255. But we need to be able to represnt negative exponents as well, What well
do is subtract 127 from the 8 bit binary value to get the actual exponent.
```
Binary Exponent	Unsigned Integer	Bias	Actual Exponent
00000000        0	                127	    -127
00000001        1	                127	    -126
00000010        2	                127	    -125
...             ...                 ...     ...
01111110        126	                127	     -1
01111111        127	                127	      0
10000000        128	                127	      1
10000001        129	                127	      2
...             ...                 ...     ...
11111110	    254	                127	    127
11111111	    255	                127	    (Reserved)
```
The binary exponent value of 11111111 (255 in decimal) is reserved for special
values like infinity and NaN (Not a Number), so it's not used for normal
floating-point numbers.

In IEEE 754 single precision floating point format, 1.0101010100 ×2^−23 is
represented as:
```
   0011 0100 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
   0 01101000 000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
   ↑    ↑      ↑   ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑    ↑
   S=0  E= 104   M= 00000000000000000000000


(gdb) x/t table_f32_f16 + 2
0x6011e8 <table_f32_f16+8>:	00110100000000000000000000000000

(gdb) p table_f32_f16[3]
$111 = 1.78813934e-07

(gdb) p/t table_f32_f16[3]
$110 = 110100010000000000000000000000

```
After that detour we have:
```console
4588	                table_gelu_f16[i] = GGML_FP32_TO_FP16(ggml_gelu_f32(f));
```
Here we are populating a lookup table with the values of the `ggml_gelu_f32`
converted to half-precision floating point values. The `ggml_gelu_f32` function
looks like this:
```console
3812	inline static float ggml_gelu_f32(float x) {
3813	    return 0.5f*x*(1.0f + tanhf(SQRT_2_OVER_PI*x*(1.0f + GELU_COEF_A*x*x)));
3814	}
```
This is done for all the possibe half-precision floating point numbers.
Similarlty this is also done for other activation functions.

Lets turn our attention to the llama_init_from_gpt_params function:
```console
std::tie(model, ctx) = llama_init_from_gpt_params(params);
```

### Tensors
Is a tensor in GGML which is defined in ggml.h in the struct `ggml_tensor`:
```c
    struct ggml_tensor {
        enum ggml_type type;
        ...
```
The type of a tensor specifies the type of data that this tensor will store.
```c++
    enum ggml_type {
        GGML_TYPE_F32     = 0,
        GGML_TYPE_F16     = 1,
        GGML_TYPE_Q4_0    = 2,
        GGML_TYPE_Q4_1    = 3,
        ...
```
Next we have then number of element which is an array which stores the number of
elements per dimension. 
```c
        int64_t ne[GGML_MAX_DIMS]; // number of elements
```
Currently the maximum number of dimensions is 4.
When reading about matrix multiplication we often see it in the format that
we create a matrix like 3x2 which means 3 rows and 2 columns. When working
with GGML, and I think this is also common with graphics libraries in general,
that one first specifies the x-axis, that is the horizontal axis/number of
columns.
```
              x-axis
ne[0]    ------------>

             |
ne[1]        | y-axis
             |
             ↓
```
So if we create a 2d tensor with 2 rows and three elements each this would become:
```
             x-axis
            -------->
ne[0] = 3   [0, 1, 2] |
ne[1] = 2   [3, 4, 5] | y-axis
                      ↓
```
For the higher dimension I like think of them encapuslating the lower dimensions.
```
ne[0] = 3
ne[1] = 2
ne[2] = 2

z_0
    [0, 1, 2]
    [3, 4, 5]
z_1
    [0, 1, 2]
    [3, 4, 5]
```
And if we add another dimension:
```
ne[0] = 3
ne[1] = 2
ne[2] = 2
ne[3] = 4

w_0
    z_0
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]
    z_1
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]

w_1
    z_0
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]
    z_1
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]

w_2
    z_0
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]
    z_1
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]

w_3
    z_0
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]
    z_1
        [0, 1, 2]
        [3, 4, 5]
```
At least this is how I think of the dimensions in GGML I try to visualize them
this way.

So if we want to create a 3x2 matrix in GGML we do the following:
```c
  struct ggml_tensor* matrix = ggml_new_tensor_2d(ctx, GGML_TYPE_F32, 2, 3);
```
This is because we are first specifying the number of elements in the first
dimension (x-axis), and then the number of elements in the second dimension
(y-axis).

Which can be visualized like this:
```
    +---+---+
    | 0 | 1 |
    +---+---+
    | 2 | 3 |
    +---+---+
    | 4 | 5 |
    +---+---+ 

ne[0] = 2 (Number of elements in the first dimension) 
ne[1] = 3 (Number of elements in the second dimension)

nb[0] = 4 (size of each element, moving this number will move to the next column)
nb[1] = 8 (stride, moving this number will move to the next row)

Memory layout:
0000 0001    0010 0011    0100 0101
  0    1      2     3       4    5
    row 1      row 2        row 3
             ↑
             8 (ne[1])
```
We can get the total number of elements of a tensor by multiplying the number of
elements in each dimension.

A tensor can be the result of an operation, which which case it's operation field
will specify the operation:
```c
        enum ggml_op op;
```
```c
    enum ggml_op {
        GGML_OP_NONE = 0,

        GGML_OP_DUP,
        GGML_OP_ADD,
        GGML_OP_ADD1,
```
Operations can accept parameters which can be values of other tensors. For values
they are stored in 
```c
        int32_t op_params[GGML_MAX_OP_PARAMS / sizeof(int32_t)];
```
And the operation takes other tensors as parameters they are stored in src:
```c
        struct ggml_tensor * src[GGML_MAX_SRCS];
```
Tensors also have a field for the gradient:
```c
        struct ggml_tensor * grad;
```
This is used to store the gradient of the tensor and this is used by the automatic
differentiation.
Tensors can also have views which is covered in a separate section.

An example can be found in [tensor.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/tensor.c).

### Views
If we inspect a tensor we can see that it contains the following:
```console
(gdb) p *x
$7 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0, ne = {10, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {
    4, 40, 40, 40}, op = GGML_OP_NONE, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, 
  src = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, perf_runs = 0, perf_cycles = 0, 
  perf_time_us = 0, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a001a0, 
  name = '\000' <repeats 63 times>, extra = 0x0, padding = "\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"}
```
So this is storing 10 elements of type float (GGML_TYPE_F32):
```console
(gdb) p ((float*) x->data)[0]
$11 = 1
(gdb) p ((float*) x->data)[1]
$12 = 2
(gdb) p ((float*) x->data)[2]
$13 = 3
(gdb) p ((float*) x->data)[4]
$14 = 5
(gdb) p ((float*) x->data)[3]
$15 = 4
(gdb) p ((float*) x->data)[9]
$16 = 10
```
Now if we create a 1d view of this tensor using:
```c
  struct ggml_tensor* view = ggml_view_1d(ctx, x, 5, (5-1) * ggml_type_size(x->type));
```
Where the first int argument is the number of elements and the second integer is
the offset in bytes. Notice that we have take into account the size for the
elements stored. Keep in mind that the index is zero based so the offset should
reflect this too.

So if our x tensor is:
```console
x[0]: 1.000000
x[1]: 2.000000
x[2]: 3.000000
x[3]: 4.000000
x[4]: 5.000000
x[5]: 6.000000
x[6]: 7.000000
x[7]: 8.000000
x[8]: 9.000000
x[9]: 10.000000
```
Then the view would be:
```console
view[0]: 5.000000
view[1]: 6.000000
view[2]: 7.000000
view[3]: 8.000000
view[4]: 9.000000
```
The element type in this case if 4. And what we are saying above is that we
want a view of 5 elements starting at the offset 16:
```
 0     4    8   12   16   20   24   28   32   36 
 [0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9]
 [1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10]

```


```c
    struct ggml_tensor * result = ggml_view_impl(ctx, a, 1, &ne0, offset);
```

```c
static struct ggml_tensor * ggml_view_impl(
        struct ggml_context * ctx,
        struct ggml_tensor  * a,
        int                   n_dims,
        const int64_t       * ne,
        size_t                offset) {
    ...
       
    struct ggml_tensor * result = ggml_new_tensor_impl(ctx, a->type, n_dims, ne, a, offset);
    ggml_format_name(result, "%s (view)", a->name);
```
If we step into this function we can see the arguments are as follows:
```console
(gdb) s
ggml_new_tensor_impl (ctx=0x7ffff7fba2a8 <g_state+8>, type=GGML_TYPE_F32, n_dims=1, ne=0x7fffffffc7e8, 
    view_src=0x7ffff6a00030, view_offs=5)
    at /home/danielbevenius/work/ai/learning-ai/fundamentals/ggml/ggml/src/ggml.c:2928
```
Notice that `view_src` is a pointer to the `x` tensor:
```console
(gdb) p x
$20 = (struct ggml_tensor *) 0x7ffff6a00030
(gdb) down
(gdb) p a
$21 = (struct ggml_tensor *) 0x7ffff6a00030
```

### Gradients
When we create a tensor we do so using the `ggml_new_tensor` functions. For
example:
```c
  struct ggml_tensor* a = ggml_new_tensor_1d(ctx, GGML_TYPE_F32, 1);
  ggml_set_param(ctx, a);
  ggml_set_i32_1d(a, 0, 2);
```
In this case `a` and `b` are tensors of type `GGML_TYPE_F32` and they will not
have any operation associated with them (op = GGML_OP_NONE).

`ggml_set_param` is worth looking closer at:
```c
void ggml_set_param(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    tensor->flags |= GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_PARAM;

    GGML_ASSERT(tensor->grad == NULL);
    tensor->grad = ggml_dup_tensor(ctx, tensor);
    ggml_format_name(tensor->grad, "%s (grad)", tensor->name);
}
```
Notice that the first line will set the `GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_PARAM` flag on the
tensor.

Lets take a look at the call where `a` is passed in:
```console
(gdb) p *tensor
$6 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0,
ne = {1, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 4, 4, 4}, op = GGML_OP_NONE, 
op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, 
view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a00180,
name = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>, extra = 0x0}
```
Notice that the `grad` field is being set to the tensor returned by
`ggml_dup_tensor` which looks like this:
```c
struct ggml_tensor * ggml_dup_tensor(struct ggml_context * ctx, const struct ggml_tensor * src) {
    return ggml_new_tensor(ctx, src->type, GGML_MAX_DIMS, src->ne);
}
```
So this is creating a new tensor with the same type as `a`, and it uses the
same shape which is specified using `src->ne`. But the data is not duplicated:
```console
(gdb) p *((float*)tensor->data)
$10 = 2
(gdb) p *((float*)tensor->grad->data)
$11 = 0
```
Just keep in mind that the gradient is also "just" a tensor which in turn can
have a gradient (second derivative) associated with it.

But `mul` is different as it takes both `a` and `b` as arguments.
```c
  struct ggml_tensor* b = ggml_new_tensor_1d(ctx, GGML_TYPE_F32, 1);
  ggml_set_param(ctx, b);
  struct ggml_tensor* mul = ggml_mul(ctx, a, b);
```

```c
struct ggml_tensor * ggml_mul(
        struct ggml_context * ctx,
        struct ggml_tensor  * a,
        struct ggml_tensor  * b) {
    return ggml_mul_impl(ctx, a, b, false);
}

static struct ggml_tensor * ggml_mul_impl(
        struct ggml_context * ctx,
        struct ggml_tensor * a,
        struct ggml_tensor * b,
        bool inplace) {
    GGML_ASSERT(ggml_can_repeat(b, a));

    bool is_node = false;

    if (!inplace && (a->grad || b->grad)) {
        // TODO: support backward pass for broadcasting
        GGML_ASSERT(ggml_are_same_shape(a, b));
        is_node = true;
    }

    if (inplace) {
        GGML_ASSERT(!is_node);
    }

    struct ggml_tensor * result = inplace ? ggml_view_tensor(ctx, a) : ggml_dup_tensor(ctx, a);

    result->op   = GGML_OP_MUL;
    result->grad = is_node ? ggml_dup_tensor(ctx, result) : NULL;
    result->src[0] = a;
    result->src[1] = b;

    return result;
}
```
In this case `is_node` will be set to true as `a` and `b` are tensors that have
a gradient associated with them as we saw above. If inplace was true a view of
the tensor is used as the result/return value, other wise a duplicate of `a` is
used. This tensor is then updated to have the operation set to `GGML_OP_MUL`
and and take `a` and `b` as sources/inputs. In this case `is_node` is true
so a duplicate of the result tensor is created as set as the gradient.

### Backend
Exploration code can be found in [backend.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/backend.c).

What is a backend in ggml?  
A backend in ggml is an interface which describes and abstracts operations on a
buffer. There are backends for CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, Metal, Kompute, SYCL, etc.

Recall that a buffer is a contiguous block of memory of fixed size and
intended to hold data while moving that data between places (in this case the
host and a device). And a buffer has a fixed size. This buffer can be on an
accelerator, like a GPU, or on the host.

All backends implement the same interface which enables them to be used in a
uniform way and there can be multiple backends available at the same time.

The backend interface is declared in `ggml/include/ggml/ggml-backend.h` and this
header contains the functions of the interface to the backend. The actual
backend is an opaque pointer:
```c
    typedef struct ggml_backend * ggml_backend_t;
```
This is a way of implementing an abstract data type in C and allows for
encapsulation. The actual implementation of the backend is hidden from the usero
of the backend. 

The actual definition of `ggml_backend` can be found in
ggml/src/ggml-backend-impl.h:
```c
    struct ggml_backend {
        ggml_guid_t guid;

        struct ggml_backend_i iface;
        ggml_backend_context_t context;
    };

    typedef void * ggml_backend_context_t;
```
So a backend has a global unique identifier (guid), an interface and a context.
And notice that the context can be anything, since it is a void pointer.

The backend interface, `iface` above, is what defines the operations that are
available for a backend which every backend must implement.
`struct ggml_backend_i` has functions like (simplified for readability):
```c
    const char* get_name();
    void free();

    ggml_backend_buffer_type_t get_default_buffer_type();
    void set_tensor_async(struct ggml_tensor* tensor,
                          const void* data,
                          size_t offset,
                          size_t size);
    void get_tensor_async(const struct ggml_tensor* tensor,
                         void* data,
                         size_t offset,
                         size_t size);
    bool cpy_tensor_async(ggml_backend_t backend_dst,
                          const struct ggml_tensor* src,
                          struct ggml_tensor * dst);

   void synchronize();
   ggml_backend_graph_plan_t graph_plan_create(const struct ggml_cgraph* cgraph);
   enum ggml_status graph_plan_compute(ggml_backend_graph_plan_t plan);
   enum ggml_status graph_compute(struct ggml_cgraph* cgraph);
   bool supports_op(const struct ggml_tensor* op);
   bool offload_op(const struct ggml_tensor* op);

   ggml_backend_event_t event_new();
   void event_free(ggml_backend_event_t event);
   void event_record(ggml_backend_event_t event);
   void event_wait(ggml_backend_event_t event);
   void event_synchronize(ggml_backend_event_t event);
```
Not all backends support async operations, for example the CPU backend does not
and the same goes for the support of events which I think are only for the
async functions.


### Tensor Allocator
```c
// Tensor allocator
struct ggml_tallocr {
    ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer;
    void * base;
    size_t alignment;
    size_t offset;
};
```
This type has a pointer to a `buffer` which is the backend buffer where tensors
will be allocated (CPU, CUDA, Vulkan, etc). The `base` is the base address of
memory region managed by this alloctor. The `alignment` is the memory alignment
for all tensors allocated by this allocator. The `offset` is the offset within
the buffer where the next tensor will be allocated.
A usage of this can be found in 
```c
static bool alloc_tensor_range(struct ggml_context * ctx,
        struct ggml_tensor * first, struct ggml_tensor * last,
        ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft, size_t size,
        ggml_backend_buffer_t ** buffers, size_t * n_buffers) {
    ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer = ggml_backend_buft_alloc_buffer(buft, size);
    ...
    struct ggml_tallocr tallocr = ggml_tallocr_new(buffer);
```
We can see that to create a tensor allocator we need a buffer:
```c
struct ggml_tallocr ggml_tallocr_new(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer) {
    void * base = ggml_backend_buffer_get_base(buffer);
    size_t align = ggml_backend_buffer_get_alignment(buffer);

    assert(align && !(align & (align - 1))); // power of 2

    struct ggml_tallocr talloc = (struct ggml_tallocr) {
        /*.buffer    = */ buffer,
        /*.base      = */ base,
        /*.alignment = */ align,
        /*.offset    = */ aligned_offset(base, 0, align),
    };
    return talloc;
}
```
Then we can pass the tensor allocator to the tensor allocation functions:
```c
                ggml_tallocr_alloc(&tallocr, t);
```

```c
void ggml_tallocr_alloc(struct ggml_tallocr * talloc, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    size_t size = ggml_backend_buffer_get_alloc_size(talloc->buffer, tensor);
    size = GGML_PAD(size, talloc->alignment);

    if (talloc->offset + size > ggml_backend_buffer_get_size(talloc->buffer)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s: not enough space in the buffer to allocate %s (needed %zu, available %zu)\n",
                __func__, tensor->name, size, ggml_backend_buffer_get_size(talloc->buffer) - talloc->offset);
        GGML_ABORT("not enough space in the buffer");
    }

    void * addr = (char *)ggml_backend_buffer_get_base(talloc->buffer) + talloc->offset;
    talloc->offset += size;

    assert(((uintptr_t)addr % talloc->alignment) == 0);

    ggml_backend_tensor_alloc(talloc->buffer, tensor, addr);
}
```
Notice that `addr` is set to the base address of the buffer plus the offset
so that it points to the next available memory location. And then the offset
is incremented.
```c
void ggml_backend_tensor_alloc(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer, struct ggml_tensor * tensor, void * addr) {
    ... // just removing asserts for readability
    tensor->buffer = buffer;
    tensor->data = addr;
    ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor(buffer, tensor);
}
```
```c
GGML_CALL void ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    // init_tensor is optional
    if (buffer->iface.init_tensor) {
        buffer->iface.init_tensor(buffer, tensor);
    }
}
```
In this case `ggml_tallocr` is used as a temporary object used to manage the
allocations with a single buffer.


### `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t`
Lets now take a closer look at the buffer type, `ggml_backend_buffer_type_t`
which is the type returned from `get_default_buffer_type()` above.

It is a typedef in `ggml/include/ggml/ggml-alloc.h`:
```c
    typedef struct ggml_backend_buffer_type * ggml_backend_buffer_type_t;
```
And the definition can be found in `ggml/src/ggml-backend-impl.h`: 
```c
    struct ggml_backend_buffer_type {
        struct ggml_backend_buffer_type_i  iface;
        ggml_backend_buffer_type_context_t context;
    };
    typedef void * ggml_backend_buffer_type_context_t;
```
Notice that a buffer type also has an interface and a context which is also a
void pointer just like the context of a backend.

So first we have an interface which describes the buffer, the buffer type
interface:
```c
    struct ggml_backend_buffer_type_i {
        const char* get_name(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft);
        size_t get_alignment(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft);
        size_t get_max_size(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft);
        size_t get_alloc_size(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft, const struct ggml_tensor * tensor);

        bool is_host(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft);
        bool supports_backend(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft, ggml_backend_t backend); 

        ggml_backend_buffer_t alloc_buffer(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft, size_t size);
    };
```
So we first have functions that describe the buffer type like the max size that
can be allocated by this buffer, the memory alignment, if it is a host or
device buffer etc. So this sort of like a memory allocator for a backend like
CUDA, CPU, Vulkan, etc. We can use this type to allocate a buffer of a certain
size using the `alloc_buffer` function.

The above mentioned functions are just describing a buffer, `alloc_buffer`
returns a `ggml_backend_buffer_t` (typedef in ggml/include/ggml/ggml-alloc.h)
which is the actual buffer that the type describes:
```c
    typedef struct ggml_backend_buffer* ggml_backend_buffer_t;

    struct ggml_backend_buffer {
        struct ggml_backend_buffer_i  iface;
        ggml_backend_buffer_type_t    buft;
        ggml_backend_buffer_context_t context;
        size_t size;
        enum ggml_backend_buffer_usage usage;
    };
```
The `iface` is the interface of a backend buffer which looks like this:
```c
    struct ggml_backend_buffer_i {
        const char* get_name()
        void free_buffer()
        void get_base();
        void init_tensor(struct ggml_tensor* tensor);
        void set_tensor(struct ggml_tensor* tensor,
                        const void* data,
                        size_t offset,
                        size_t size);
        void get_tensor(const struct ggml_tensor* tensor,
                        void* data,
                        size_t offset,
                        size_t size);
        bool cpy_tensor(const struct ggml_tensor* src,
                        struct ggml_tensor * dst);
        void clear(uint8_t value);
        void reset();
    };
```
With an instance of this type we can initialize tensors in the backend, set and
get tensors, copy tensors, clear the buffer, reset the buffer etc.
```c
  ggml_backend_t backend = ggml_backend_cpu_init();
  ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer = ggml_backend_alloc_ctx_tensors(ctx, backend);
```

`ggml_backend_buffer_type_t` is something we've already seen earlier as it the
context.
`ggml_backend_buffer_usage` is defined as follows:
```
    enum ggml_backend_buffer_usage {
        GGML_BACKEND_BUFFER_USAGE_ANY = 0,
        GGML_BACKEND_BUFFER_USAGE_WEIGHTS = 1,
    };
```
So `ggml_backend_buffer_i` is the bottom most interface and this is what
interacts with the actual memory. For example, `set_tensor` will set the tensor
on a backend, which for a device would mean copying the data from the host to
the device:
```c
static void ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_set_tensor(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer,
                                                ggml_tensor* tensor,
                                                const void* data,
                                                size_t offset,
                                                size_t size) {
    ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_context * ctx = (ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_context *)buffer->context;

    ggml_cuda_set_device(ctx->device);
    CUDA_CHECK(
        cudaMemcpyAsync((char *)tensor->data + offset,
                        data,
                        size,
                        cudaMemcpyHostToDevice,
                        cudaStreamPerThread));
    CUDA_CHECK(cudaStreamSynchronize(cudaStreamPerThread));
}
```

But of the CPU backend would just be `memcpy` function call:
```c
static void ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_set_tensor(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer,
                                               struct ggml_tensor* tensor,
                                               const void* data,
                                               size_t offset,
                                               size_t size) {
    memcpy((char *)tensor->data + offset, data, size);
    GGML_UNUSED(buffer);
}
```

`cpu_backend_i` is defined in ggml/src/ggml-backend-cpu.c:
```c++
static struct ggml_backend_i cpu_backend_i = {
    /* .get_name                = */ ggml_backend_cpu_name,
    /* .free                    = */ ggml_backend_cpu_free,
    /* .get_default_buffer_type = */ ggml_backend_cpu_get_default_buffer_type,
    /* .set_tensor_async        = */ NULL,
    /* .get_tensor_async        = */ NULL,
    /* .cpy_tensor_async        = */ NULL,
    /* .synchronize             = */ NULL,
    /* .graph_plan_create       = */ ggml_backend_cpu_graph_plan_create,
    /* .graph_plan_free         = */ ggml_backend_cpu_graph_plan_free,
    /* .graph_plan_compute      = */ ggml_backend_cpu_graph_plan_compute,
    /* .graph_compute           = */ ggml_backend_cpu_graph_compute,
    /* .supports_op             = */ ggml_backend_cpu_supports_op,
    /* .offload_op              = */ NULL,
    /* .event_new               = */ NULL,
    /* .event_free              = */ NULL,
    /* .event_record            = */ NULL,
    /* .event_wait              = */ NULL,
    /* .event_synchronize       = */ NULL,
};
```
Notice that the CPU backend does not support asynchronous operations, and also
does not support events which I'm guessing are used for the asynchronous
operations.

And the `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type` function is defined as follows:
```
GGML_CALL ggml_backend_buffer_type_t ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type(void) {
    static struct ggml_backend_buffer_type ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type = {
        /* .iface = */ {
            /* .get_name         = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_get_name,
            /* .alloc_buffer     = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_alloc_buffer,
            /* .get_alignment    = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_get_alignment,
            /* .get_max_size     = */ NULL, // defaults to SIZE_MAX
            /* .get_alloc_size   = */ NULL, // defaults to ggml_nbytes
            /* .supports_backend = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_supports_backend,
            /* .is_host          = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_is_host,
        },
        /* .context = */ NULL,
    };

    return &ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type;
}
```

Every tensor has a backend type and and may have buffer:
```console
(gdb) p x
$14 = (struct ggml_tensor *) 0x7ffff6a00030
(gdb) p *x
$15 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32,
       backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU,
       buffer = 0x0, ne = {10, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 40, 40, 40},
       op = GGML_OP_NONE, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>},
       flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
       0x0, 0x0}, perf_runs = 0, perf_cycles = 0, perf_time_us = 0,
       view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a001a0,
       name = '\000' <repeats 63 times>, extra = 0x0, padding = "\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"}

(gdb) p x.backend
$16 = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU
(gdb) p x.buffer
$17 = (struct ggml_backend_buffer *) 0x0
```

One thing I noticed is that when we call `ggml_backend_tensor_set` the backend
of the tensor is still CPU in the CUDA case. I would have expected that the
backend would be GPU. It looks like some of the backends set the tensors backend
to GPU but the CPU backend does not. For example the sycl backend does as does
the kompute backend.

The following is a suggestion to update the CUDA backend to also set the
tensor backend to GPU:
```console
$ git diff src/ggml-cuda.cu

```
The final thing to happen in this function is that ggml_backend_buffer_init is
called.
```c
GGML_CALL ggml_backend_buffer_t ggml_backend_buffer_init(
               ggml_backend_buffer_type_t      buft,
        struct ggml_backend_buffer_i           iface,
               ggml_backend_buffer_context_t   context,
               size_t                          size) {
    ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer = malloc(sizeof(struct ggml_backend_buffer));

    (*buffer) = (struct ggml_backend_buffer) {
        /* .interface = */ iface,
        /* .buft      = */ buft,
        /* .context   = */ context,
        /* .size      = */ size,
        /* .usage     = */ GGML_BACKEND_BUFFER_USAGE_ANY
    };

    return buffer;
}
```

```console

895	    struct ggml_tallocr tallocr = ggml_tallocr_new(buffer);
896	
897	    for (struct ggml_tensor * t = first; t != last; t = ggml_get_next_tensor(ctx, t)) {
898	        if (t->data == NULL) {
899	            if (t->view_src == NULL) {
900	                ggml_tallocr_alloc(&tallocr, t);
901	            } else if (t->buffer == NULL) {
902	                ggml_backend_view_init(buffer, t);
903	            }
904	        } else {
```
```c
void ggml_tallocr_alloc(struct ggml_tallocr * talloc, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    size_t size = ggml_backend_buffer_get_alloc_size(talloc->buffer, tensor);
    size = GGML_PAD(size, talloc->alignment);

    if (talloc->offset + size > ggml_backend_buffer_get_size(talloc->buffer)) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s: not enough space in the buffer to allocate %s (needed %zu, available %zu)\n",
                __func__, tensor->name, size, ggml_backend_buffer_get_size(talloc->buffer) - talloc->offset);
        GGML_ASSERT(!"not enough space in the buffer");
        return;
    }

    void * addr = (char *)ggml_backend_buffer_get_base(talloc->buffer) + talloc->offset;
    talloc->offset += size;

    assert(((uintptr_t)addr % talloc->alignment) == 0);

    ggml_backend_tensor_alloc(talloc->buffer, tensor, addr);
}
``` 
The call to `ggml_backend_tensor_alloc` will set the tensors buffer and
data (which my be null):
```c
void ggml_backend_tensor_alloc(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer, struct ggml_tensor * tensor, void * addr) {
    GGML_ASSERT(tensor->buffer == NULL);
    GGML_ASSERT(tensor->data == NULL);
    GGML_ASSERT(tensor->view_src == NULL);
    GGML_ASSERT(addr >= ggml_backend_buffer_get_base(buffer));
    GGML_ASSERT((char *)addr + ggml_backend_buffer_get_alloc_size(buffer, tensor) <=
                (char *)ggml_backend_buffer_get_base(buffer) + ggml_backend_buffer_get_size(buffer));

    tensor->buffer = buffer;
    tensor->data = addr;
    ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor(buffer, tensor);
}
```
The last function call will then `ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor` will then
...

Before this call the tensor looks like this:
```console
(gdb) p *tensor
$38 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x41ac880, ne = {10, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 40, 
    40, 40}, op = GGML_OP_NONE, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, perf_runs = 0, perf_cycles = 0, perf_time_us = 0, view_src = 0x0, 
  view_offs = 0, data = 0x7fff94c00200, name = "x", '\000' <repeats 62 times>, extra = 0x0, 
  padding = "\000\000\000\000\000\000\000"}
```

```c
GGML_CALL void ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    // init_tensor is optional
    if (buffer->iface.init_tensor) {
        buffer->iface.init_tensor(buffer, tensor);
    }
}
```
```console
(gdb) p buffer->iface.init_tensor
$39 = (void (*)(ggml_backend_buffer_t, 
    struct ggml_tensor *)) 0x4e20c4 <ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_init_tensor(ggml_backend_buffer_t, ggml_tensor*)>
```
So that will land us in `ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_init_tensor`:
```console
(gdb) s
ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_init_tensor (buffer=0x41ac880, tensor=0x7fffcaa00030)
    at /home/danielbevenius/work/ai/learning-ai/fundamentals/ggml/ggml/src/ggml-cuda.cu:402
402	    ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_context * ctx = (ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_context *)buffer->context;
```
So lets take a closer look at this function:
```c
GGML_CALL static void ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_init_tensor(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer, ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_context * ctx = (ggml_backend_cuda_buffer_context *)buffer->context;

    if (tensor->view_src != NULL) {
        assert(tensor->view_src->buffer->buft == buffer->buft);
        return;
    }

    if (ggml_is_quantized(tensor->type)) {
        // initialize padding to 0 to avoid possible NaN values
        size_t original_size = ggml_nbytes(tensor);
        size_t padded_size = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(buffer->buft, tensor);

        if (padded_size > original_size && tensor->view_src == nullptr) {
            ggml_cuda_set_device(ctx->device);
            CUDA_CHECK(cudaMemset((char *)tensor->data + original_size, 0, padded_size - original_size));
        }
    }
    // The following line was added by me as a suggestion that the cuda backend
    // should set this to GPU (change it from CPU).
    tensor->backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_GPU;
}
```
```console
(gdb) p *ctx
$41 = {device = 0, dev_ptr = 0x7fff94c00200, name = "CUDA0"}
(gdb) p tensor->view_src
$42 = (ggml_tensor *) 0x0
(gdb) p ggml_is_quantized(tensor->type)
$43 = false
```

_wip_

#### Forward expand
After we have created tensors we need to create a computation graph that will
drive the forward pass. Building upon the multiplication example from earlier
where we have `mul = a * b` we can create a graph like this:
```c
  struct ggml_cgraph* f_graph = ggml_new_graph_custom(ctx, GGML_DEFAULT_GRAPH_SIZE, true);
```

```c
struct ggml_cgraph * ggml_new_graph_custom(struct ggml_context * ctx, size_t size, bool grads) {
    ...
    void* p = cgraph + 1;

    struct ggml_tensor** nodes_ptr = incr_ptr_aligned(&p, size* sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*),
        sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*));
```
The `incr_ptr_aligned` is used to increment a pointer while ensuring proper alignment. So p is
the pointer to be be incremented, and size is how much we want to increment the pointer by.
And align is how it should be aligned which in this case is the size of a tensor pointer.
```c
static void * incr_ptr_aligned(void ** p, size_t size, size_t align) {
    void * ptr = *p;
    ptr = (void *) GGML_PAD((uintptr_t) ptr, align);
    *p = (void *) ((char *) ptr + size);
    return ptr;
}
```
So above we first deref the pointer that we want to increment, then pad it using the
`GGML_PAD` macro. The third line will increment (the char cast is just to enable pointer
arithmetic) the pointer by the size we want to increment it by.

And then we do the same for the leafs in the graph:
```c
    struct ggml_tensor** leafs_ptr = incr_ptr_aligned(&p, size* sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*),
        sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*));
```
And similarly for the hash keys and grads:
```c

    struct ggml_tensor** hash_keys_ptr = incr_ptr_aligned(&p,
        hash_size* sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*), sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*));

    struct ggml_tensor** grads_ptr = grads ?
        incr_ptr_aligned(&p, size* sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*), sizeof(struct ggml_tensor*)) :
        NULL;

    ggml_bitset_t* hash_used = incr_ptr_aligned(&p, ggml_bitset_size(hash_size) * sizeof(ggml_bitset_t), sizeof(ggml_bitset_t));
```
These pointer will then be used to create a `ggml_cgraph` struct:
```c
    *cgraph = (struct ggml_cgraph) {
        /*.size         =*/ size,
        /*.n_nodes      =*/ 0,
        /*.n_leafs      =*/ 0,
        /*.nodes        =*/ nodes_ptr,
        /*.grads        =*/ grads_ptr,
        /*.leafs        =*/ leafs_ptr,
        /*.hash_table   =*/ { hash_size, hash_used, hash_keys_ptr },
        /*.order        =*/ GGML_CGRAPH_EVAL_ORDER_LEFT_TO_RIGHT,
};
```
Just to clarify that all tensors in the graph are nodes. In ggml any node that
is an operation or any node that participates in gradient computation.
Notice that we create a `.hash_table` which is a struct with a size, a pointer to
a bitset and a pointer to the hash keys (pointers to tensors).
```c
    typedef uint32_t ggml_bitset_t;

    struct ggml_hash_set {
        size_t size;
        ggml_bitset_t * used;
        struct ggml_tensor ** keys;
    };
```
```console
(lldb) p cgraph->visited_hash_set
(ggml_hash_set) {
  size = 4099
  used = 0x000000015c014980
  keys = 0x000000015c008968
}
```
Next we have:
```c
    ggml_hash_set_reset(&cgraph->visited_hash_set);
```
```c
void ggml_hash_set_reset(struct ggml_hash_set * hash_set) {
    memset(hash_set->used, 0, sizeof(ggml_bitset_t) * ggml_bitset_size(hash_set->size));
}
```
So this is writing 516 bytes of 0 to the used `visited_hash_set` which is just to initialize
it to 0. After that the compute graph is ready to be used and returned.

Lets inspect the compute graph:
```console
(lldb) p *cgraph
(ggml_cgraph) {
  size = 2048
  n_nodes = 0
  n_leafs = 0
  nodes = 0x0000000136000968
  grads = 0x0000000136010980
  leafs = 0x0000000136004968
  visited_hash_set = {
    size = 4099
    used = 0x0000000136014980
    keys = 0x0000000136008968
  }
  order = GGML_CGRAPH_EVAL_ORDER_LEFT_TO_RIGHT
}
```
Next lets look at the `ggml_build_forward_expand` function:
```c
  ggml_build_forward_expand(f_graph, mul);
```

```c
void ggml_build_forward_expand(struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    ggml_build_forward_impl(cgraph, tensor, true);
}
```
Notice that this is passing `true` as `expand`:
```c
static void ggml_build_forward_impl(struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph,
    struct ggml_tensor * tensor, bool expand) {
    if (!expand) {
        // TODO: this branch isn't accessible anymore, maybe move this to ggml_build_forward_expand
        ggml_graph_clear(cgraph);
    }

    const int n0 = cgraph->n_nodes;

    ggml_visit_parents(cgraph, tensor);

    const int n_new = cgraph->n_nodes - n0;
    GGML_PRINT_DEBUG("%s: visited %d new nodes\n", __func__, n_new);

    if (n_new > 0) {
        // the last added node should always be starting point
        GGML_ASSERT(cgraph->nodes[cgraph->n_nodes - 1] == tensor);
    }
}
```
In our case `n0` is 0. Lets take a look at the `ggml_visit_parents` function, 
which will be passed the `mul` tensor:
```c
static void ggml_visit_parents(struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, struct ggml_tensor * node) {
    if (node->grad == NULL) {
        if (node->op != GGML_OP_NONE) {
            //GGML_PRINT_DEBUG("%s: warning: node %p has no grad, but op %d\n", __func__, (void *) node, node->op);
        }
    }

    // check if already visited
    if (ggml_hash_insert(&cgraph->visited_hash_set, node) == GGML_HASHSET_ALREADY_EXISTS) {
        return;
    }
```
Next lets look at `ggml_hash_insert`. The `node` is the tensor that we passed in
to `ggml_build_forward_expand` which is:
```console
(lldb) p node->op
(ggml_op) GGML_OP_MUL
(gdb) p node->name
$4 = "mul", '\000' <repeats 60 times>
```

```c
static size_t ggml_hash_insert(struct ggml_hash_set * hash_set, struct ggml_tensor * key) {
    size_t h = ggml_hash(key) % hash_set->size;

    // linear probing
    size_t i = h;
    do {
        if (!ggml_bitset_get(hash_set->used, i)) {
            ggml_bitset_set(hash_set->used, i);
            hash_set->keys[i] = key;
            return i;
        }
        if (hash_set->keys[i] == key) {
            return GGML_HASHSET_ALREADY_EXISTS;
        }
        i = (i + 1) % hash_set->size;
    } while (i != h);

    // visited all hash table entries -> not found
    GGML_ABORT("fatal error");
}
```
Now, `ggml_hash` uses the pointer of the tensor (minus the padding) as the hash:
```c
// hash function for ggml_tensor
static inline size_t ggml_hash(const struct ggml_tensor * p) {
    // the last 4 bits are always zero due to alignment
    return (size_t)(uintptr_t)p >> 4;
}
```
So we have a `hash_set->size` of 4099 and we need the map the hash value into this
range of values which is what the modulo operation is used for.
If we know the size of the visited hash (4099 in this case) we can get the hash
for any tensor:
```console
(gdb) p ggml_hash(node) % cgraph->visited_hash_set->size
$7 = 3843
```
This might be handy to do later when debugging.

```c
static size_t ggml_hash_insert(struct ggml_hash_set * hash_set, struct ggml_tensor * key) {
    size_t h = ggml_hash(key) % hash_set->size;
```
Next, we have the following where the hash value is used (and the key is the tensor):
```c
    // linear probing
    size_t i = h;
    do {
        if (!ggml_bitset_get(hash_set->used, i)) {
            ggml_bitset_set(hash_set->used, i);
            hash_set->keys[i] = key;
            return i;
        }
        if (hash_set->keys[i] == key) {
            return GGML_HASHSET_ALREADY_EXISTS;
        }
        i = (i + 1) % hash_set->size;
    } while (i != h);
```

```c
#define BITSET_SHR 5 // log2(sizeof(ggml_bitset_t)*8)
#define BITSET_MASK (sizeof(ggml_bitset_t)*8 - 1) // 31

static inline bool ggml_bitset_get(const ggml_bitset_t * bitset, size_t i) {
    return !!(bitset[i >> BITSET_SHR] & (1u << (i & BITSET_MASK)));
}
```
So lets take a look at a concrete example and lets say that `i` is 37:
```
i = 37
BITSET_SHR = 5
BITSET_MASK = 31 (binary: 00011111)

i >> BITSET_SHR:
37 in binary:        00100101
37 >> 5:             00000001

i & BITSET_MASK:
37 in binary:        00100101
BITSET_MASK:         00011111
37 & BITSET_MASK:    00000101

1u << (i & BITSET_MASK)
1 in binary:         00000001
1 << 5:              00100000  (32 in decimal)

Now, the bitset is passed but lets say it is 10100000:
bitset[1]:           10100000
Bit mask:            00100000
bitset[1] & mask:    00100000

!!(00100000)

First !: 00100000 becomes 0
Second !: 0 becomes 1
Final result: 1 (true, the bit is set)
```
In our case (debugging session, not the above example) the bit is not set and we
will enter the if block:
```c
        if (!ggml_bitset_get(hash_set->used, i)) {
            ggml_bitset_set(hash_set->used, i);
            hash_set->keys[i] = key;
            return i;
        }
```
Next the bitset will be set for this hash (i) and then the key will be set to
the tensor that we passed in and the hash returned (recall that we are in
`ggml_hash_insert`):
```c
    // check if already visited
    if (ggml_hash_insert(&cgraph->visited_hash_set, node) == GGML_HASHSET_ALREADY_EXISTS) {
        return;
    }
```
Following that we have (in `ggml_visit_parents`):
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_SRC; ++i) {
        const int k =
            (cgraph->order == GGML_CGRAPH_EVAL_ORDER_LEFT_TO_RIGHT) ? i :
            (cgraph->order == GGML_CGRAPH_EVAL_ORDER_RIGHT_TO_LEFT) ? (GGML_MAX_SRC-1-i) :
            /* unknown order, just fall back to using i*/ i;
        if (node->src[k]) {
            ggml_visit_parents(cgraph, node->src[k]);
        }
    }

#define GGML_MAX_SRC            10
```
This will visit the parents of the children of the tensor that was passed in. In
our case `k` will be 0 so we will visit the first child:
```console
(lldb) p node->src[0]->name
(char[64]) "a"
```
Now, `a` does not have any parents (src) so the for loop in `ggml_visit_parents`
will just iterate over all the `GGML_MAX_SRC` which is 10 and then exit the
for loop. After that we have the following if statement:
```c
    if (node->op == GGML_OP_NONE && node->grad == NULL) {
        // reached a leaf node, not part of the gradient graph (e.g. a constant)
        GGML_ASSERT(cgraph->n_leafs < cgraph->size);

        if (strlen(node->name) == 0) {
            ggml_format_name(node, "leaf_%d", cgraph->n_leafs);
        }

        cgraph->leafs[cgraph->n_leafs] = node;
        cgraph->n_leafs++;
    } else {
        GGML_ASSERT(cgraph->n_nodes < cgraph->size);

        if (strlen(node->name) == 0) {
            ggml_format_name(node, "node_%d", cgraph->n_nodes);
        }

        cgraph->nodes[cgraph->n_nodes] = node;
        if (cgraph->grads) {
            cgraph->grads[cgraph->n_nodes] = node->grad;
        }
        cgraph->n_nodes++;
    }
```
For `a` it is not an operation, but it does have a grad so the else block will
be executed. If `a` did no have a name it would get one now (node_0). And then
the cgraphs nodes array will be updated with the tensor. And in this case
cgraph->grads will not be null so the `grad` of `a` will be set to the
corresponding index in the grads array. And then the `n_nodes` counter will be
updated.
```console
(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(cgraph)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 1
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
n_leafs = 0
========================================
```
`x` stands for parameter, and the other possible value is `g` which stands for
gradient.

So that was the first parent of the mul tensor so we will be back in the
for loop in `ggml_visit_parents` to process the second parent/src which is `b`.
Simliar to `a` `b` does not have any parents so the for loop will just iterate
over all the `GGML_MAX_SRC` which is 10 and then exit the for loop.
```console
(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(cgraph)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 2
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
n_leafs = 0
========================================
```
After this the for loop in `ggml_visit_parents` will try to visit the third
parent but there are no more so this loop will continue through all the 8 left
and exit the loop.
This time we do have an operation (GGML_OP_MUL) but we also have a gradient so
so this will also enter the else block like we did for `a`and `b`.
```console
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 3
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g
n_leafs = 0
========================================
```
And that is the last of `ggml_visit_parents` and this will return us to
`ggml_build_forward_impl`.
```c
    ggml_visit_parents(cgraph, tensor);

    const int n_new = cgraph->n_nodes - n0;
    GGML_PRINT_DEBUG("%s: visited %d new nodes\n", __func__, n_new);

    if (n_new > 0) {
        // the last added node should always be starting point
        GGML_ASSERT(cgraph->nodes[cgraph->n_nodes - 1] == tensor);
    }
```
And that is the last of `ggml_build_forward_expand`.

### Graph Compute

After we have created a cgraph and called `ggml_build_forward_expand` we can
then call `ggml_graph_compute`:
```c
  int n_threads = 1;
  ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(ctx, f_graph, n_threads);
```
I'm just using 1 thread to simplfy stepping through the code in the debugger.

```c
enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(struct ggml_context * ctx,
    struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, int n_threads) {
    struct ggml_cplan cplan = ggml_graph_plan(cgraph, n_threads);

    struct ggml_object * obj = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_WORK_BUFFER, cplan.work_size);

    cplan.work_data = (uint8_t *)ctx->mem_buffer + obj->offs;

    return ggml_graph_compute(cgraph, &cplan);
}
```
So before we can compute we need to create a plan. So what is a plan? 
```c   
    struct ggml_cplan {
        size_t    work_size;
        uint8_t * work_data;

        int n_threads;
        struct ggml_threadpool * threadpool;

        // abort ggml_graph_compute when true
        ggml_abort_callback abort_callback;
        void *              abort_callback_data;
    };
```
TODO: look into the threadpool.
I'm going to skip the threadpool for now and revisit as my focus is on the
computation in this section.

```c
struct ggml_cplan ggml_graph_plan(
          const struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph,
                               int   n_threads,
            struct ggml_threadpool * threadpool) {

    if (threadpool == NULL) {
        GGML_PRINT_DEBUG("Threadpool is not specified. Will create a disposable threadpool : n_threads %d\n", n_threads);
    }
    if (n_threads <= 0) {
        n_threads = threadpool ? threadpool->n_threads_max : GGML_DEFAULT_N_THREADS;
    }

    size_t work_size = 0;

    struct ggml_cplan cplan;
    memset(&cplan, 0, sizeof(struct ggml_cplan));
    ...
```
After the computation plan has been created we can call `ggml_graph_compute`:
```c
    return ggml_graph_compute(cgraph, &cplan);
```
```c
enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute(struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, struct ggml_cplan * cplan) {
    ...
    } else {
        atomic_store_explicit(&threadpool->n_threads_cur, 1, memory_order_relaxed);
        ggml_graph_compute_thread(&threadpool->workers[0]);
    }
```
```c
static thread_ret_t ggml_graph_compute_thread(void * data) {
    struct ggml_compute_state * state = (struct ggml_compute_state *) data;
    struct ggml_threadpool    * tp    = state->threadpool;

    const struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph = tp->cgraph;
    const struct ggml_cplan  * cplan  = tp->cplan;

    set_numa_thread_affinity(state->ith);

    struct ggml_compute_params params = {
        /*.ith       =*/ state->ith,
        /*.nth       =*/ atomic_load_explicit(&tp->n_threads_cur, memory_order_relaxed),
        /*.wsize     =*/ cplan->work_size,
        /*.wdata     =*/ cplan->work_data,
        /*.threadpool=*/ tp,
    };

    for (int node_n = 0; node_n < cgraph->n_nodes && !tp->abort; node_n++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = cgraph->nodes[node_n];

        ggml_compute_forward(&params, node);

        if (state->ith == 0 && cplan->abort_callback &&
                cplan->abort_callback(cplan->abort_callback_data)) {
            tp->abort = true;
            tp->ec    = GGML_STATUS_ABORTED;
        }

        ggml_barrier(state->threadpool);
    }

    return 0;
}
```
In our case the computation graph looks like this:
```console
(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(cgraph)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 3
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g
n_leafs = 0
========================================

(gdb) p cgraph->nodes[0]->name
$51 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>

(gdb) p cgraph->nodes[1]->name
$52 = "b", '\000' <repeats 62 times>

(gdb) p cgraph->nodes[2]->name
$53 = "mul", '\000' <repeats 60 times>
```
So the above will iterate over all the nodes in the graph and call
`ggml_compute_forward` for each one. The first one will be `a`.
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward(struct ggml_compute_params * params, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    GGML_ASSERT(params);

    if (tensor->op == GGML_OP_NONE || ggml_is_empty(tensor)) {
        return;
    }
```
In the case of `a` and `b` these don't have an operation so they will just
return. But for `mul` this is more interesting:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward(struct ggml_compute_params * params, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    GGML_ASSERT(params);

    if (tensor->op == GGML_OP_NONE || ggml_is_empty(tensor)) {
        return;
    }

    switch (tensor->op) {
        ...
        case GGML_OP_MUL:
            {
                ggml_compute_forward_mul(params, tensor);
            } break;
        ...
```
And `ggml_compute_forward_mul` petty much delegates to
`ggml_compute_forward_mul_f32` in this case:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward_mul(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
        struct ggml_tensor * dst) {

    const struct ggml_tensor * src0 = dst->src[0];
    const struct ggml_tensor * src1 = dst->src[1];

    GGML_ASSERT(src1->type == GGML_TYPE_F32 && "only f32 src1 supported for now");

    switch (src0->type) {
        case GGML_TYPE_F32:
            {
                ggml_compute_forward_mul_f32(params, dst);
            } break;
        default:
            {
                GGML_ABORT("fatal error");
            }
    }
}
```
Note that `ggml_compute_forward_mul_f32` is passed the `dst` tensor which is
`mul` in our case. TODO: I'm sure I've discussed this function else where
so copy this here instead of duplicating it.

This might be obvious but the above does not modify or use the grad fields in
any way. That part is handled by the backward pass which is composed of a
backward expand followed by a backward compute (though the compute is the same
`ggml_graph_compute` function but using a different graph).

### Backward expand
For the backward computation we need to create a graph what will handle the
gradients. This is done in a simliar manner to the forward pass where we created
a graph and then expanded it, and then performed the computation.

Here we will duplicate the forward graph first and then expand it:
```c
  struct ggml_cgraph* b_graph = ggml_graph_dup(ctx, f_graph);
```
```console
(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(f_graph)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 3
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g
n_leafs = 0
========================================

(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(b_graph)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 3
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g
n_leafs = 0
========================================
```
So before we perform the backward expansion the graphs are identical.

```c
  ggml_build_backward_expand(ctx, f_graph, b_graph, /*accumulate*/ false, /* keep gradients */ false);
```
```c
void ggml_build_backward_expand(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_cgraph * gf,
    struct ggml_cgraph * gb, bool keep) {

    ...

    // keep tables of original gradients for replacement/accumulation logic
    struct ggml_hash_set zero_table = ggml_hash_set_new(gf->size);
    struct ggml_hash_set acc_table  = ggml_hash_set_new(gf->size);
    for (int i = 0; i < gf->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = gf->nodes[i];

        if (node->grad) {
            {
                const size_t insert_result = ggml_hash_insert(&zero_table, node->grad);
                GGML_ASSERT(insert_result != GGML_HASHSET_FULL);
                GGML_ASSERT(insert_result != GGML_HASHSET_ALREADY_EXISTS);
            }

            // only gradients of trainable parameters should be accumulated
            if (accumulate && (node->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_PARAM)) {
                const size_t insert_result = ggml_hash_insert(&acc_table, node->grad);
                GGML_ASSERT(insert_result != GGML_HASHSET_FULL);
                GGML_ASSERT(insert_result != GGML_HASHSET_ALREADY_EXISTS);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Notice that this is using the forward compute graph (gf).

We can inspect the gradients:
```console
(lldb) p gf->grads[0]->name
(char[64]) "a (grad)"
(lldb) p gf->grads[1]->name
(char[64]) "b (grad)"
(lldb) p gf->grads[2]
(ggml_tensor *) 0x00000001358007a0
(lldb) p gf->nodes[2]->grad
(ggml_tensor *) 0x00000001358007a0
```
Lets start with this `ggml_hash_set` named `zero_table`. Keeping track of the
gradients that are zero might enable optimizations, like skipping some
calculations or using speciallized algorithms for sparse gradients. But at this
point in the code the `zero_table` is simply being populated with all the
gradient tensors (for a, b, and mul in our case). Recall that the keys in the
hash set are the hashes like we mentioned earlier. But when debugging we can see
the hash values and check, for example for the `b (grad)` tensor:
```console
(lldb) p *zero_table->keys[1392]->name
(char) 'b'
```
And notice that if the grandient tensor (key) is not in the set it will be added and
set to they key, and the hash returned.

After that we have where we will iterate over all the nodes in the forward graph,
but in reverse order, so we will start with `mul`:
```c
    for (int i = gf->n_nodes - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = gf->nodes[i];

        // inplace operations to add gradients are not created by ggml_compute_backward except for gradient accumulation
        // use allocator to automatically make inplace operations
        if (node->grad) {
            ggml_compute_backward(ctx, node, &zero_table, &acc_table);
        }
    }
```
This will start with `mul`. And notice that we are passing in the `zero_table`
to `ggml_compute_backward`. Now, recall that we are currently in
`ggml_build_backward_expand` and I was not expecting to see this
`ggml_compute_backward`  function call here! What does this do?  
Lets take a look at this function:
```c
static void ggml_compute_backward(struct ggml_context * ctx,
    struct ggml_tensor * tensor, struct ggml_hash_set * zero_table,
    struct ggml_hash_set * acc_table) {
    struct ggml_tensor * src0 = tensor->src[0];
    struct ggml_tensor * src1 = tensor->src[1];
    struct ggml_tensor * src2 = tensor->src[2];

    switch (tensor->op) {
```
We can check that `src0` is `a` and `src1` is `b`:
```console
(lldb) p src0->name
(char[64]) "a"
(lldb) p src1->name
(char[64]) "b"
```
And after that we have a switch statement and different cases for the different
operations.
```c
        case GGML_OP_MUL:
            {
                if (src0->grad) {
                    src0->grad =
                        ggml_add_or_set(ctx,
                                src0->grad,
                                ggml_mul(ctx, src1, tensor->grad),
                                zero_table, acc_table);
                }
                if (src1->grad) {
                    src1->grad =
                        ggml_add_or_set(ctx,
                                src1->grad,
                                ggml_mul(ctx, src0, tensor->grad),
                                zero_table, acc_table);
                }
            } break;
```
We can see that this is setting the `src0->grad` tensor to some tensor.
Now, recall we have something that looks like this `mul = a * b`:
Think of this as:
```
mul    =    a * b
tensor = src0 * src1
```
And we have the derivative function definition:
```
 f(a+h) - f(a)
 -------------
      h

f(a) = a * b
```
And we want to find out how our function `f(a * b)` will change if we make
a small change to 'a' (the partial derivative of a that is):
```
 df/da = ((a + h) * b) - (a * b) / h
 df/da = ab + hb - ab / h
 df/da = ab - ab + hb / h
 df/da = hb / h
 df/da = b
```
So that is the partial derivitive of `a`. Now we want to find out how our new
loss value will effect a. This can be done by taking derivative of the loss
with respect to the output of the multiplication operation node multiplied
by the derivative of a:
```
∂L/∂a = (∂L/∂z) * (∂z/∂a) = (∂L/∂z) * b
```
This is what the following line is doing:
```c
    ggml_mul(ctx, src1, tensor->grad),
```
So the result of this operation is what we want to add to the gradient of a. We
need add this value to the gradient of a becuase `a` might be used in other
places in the graph and we don't want to loose any information which is what
would happen if we just replaced the gradient. Also keep in mind that this is
only defining an operation and returning the tensor representing that operation.

The loss value indicates how well our system is performing relative to what we
want it to do.

After that `ggml_add_or_set` is called with this new tensor:
```c
static struct ggml_tensor * ggml_add_or_set(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_tensor * a,
    struct ggml_tensor * b, struct ggml_hash_set * zero_table) {
    if (ggml_hash_contains(zero_table, a)) {
        return b;
    } else {
        return ggml_add_impl(ctx, a, b, false);
    }
}
```
Keep in mind that a is the grandient (`a_grad`) in this case and that tensor of the
multiplication operation of src1 and tensor-grad. In this case remember that
the b tensor is the gradient of the multiplication operation node and not 'b'
in our example (was not the best choice of names perhaps on my part for this).
So if the a->grad is in the zero hash set then we will return b, which makes sense,
as we don't have to perform the add operation in that case.

The result of this is then set to update the gradient of `a`:
```c
        src0->grad =
```
The same is done for src1.

The last thing to be done in `ggml_compute_backward` is just the following checks:
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_SRC; ++i) {
        if (tensor->src[i] && tensor->src[i]->grad) {
            GGML_ASSERT(ggml_are_same_shape(tensor->src[i], tensor->src[i]->grad));
        }
}
```
This will then return to `ggml_build_backward_expand` and we will continue with
the next node which is `b`.

What `ggml_compute_backward` did was it added tensor operations for the
grandients of of the parents of `mul` (a and b) but it did not "compute"
anything at this point which I what I think got me a little confused by the name
of this function. But the actual computation will be done in the
`ggml_graph_compute` function just like in the forward computation. My current
understanding of this function is that it will build/create the gradient tensors
according to the operation of the tensor like `mul` above.

Following that we have:
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < gf->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = gf->nodes[i];

        if (node->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_PARAM) {
            GGML_PRINT_DEBUG("%s: found root node %p\n", __func__, (void *) node);
            ggml_build_forward_expand(gb, node->grad);
        }
    }
```
This is iterating over all the nodes in the forward graph so it will start
with tensor a. But notice that it is using the backward computation graph (gb)
and it is passing it's gradient tensor `grad` to `ggml_build_forward_expand`. 
This is important to understand that we passing in the grandient of the node and
not the node itself.
We can inspect the first node to be expanded which is `a`
```console
(gdb) p node->name
$91 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>

(gdb) p *node->grad
$90 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0, ne = {1, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 4, 4, 4}, op = GGML_OP_MUL,
op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x7ffff6a28ff0, src = {0x7ffff6a00330, 0x7ffff6a007b0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a28fc0, name = '\000' <repeats 63 times>, extra = 0x0}
```
Notice that the `grad` now has parents (src) which are the ones that we added
by `ggml_compute_backward` above. And the first one is `b` which matches what
we discussed above. 
```console

(gdb) p *node->grad->src[0]->name
$92 = 98 'b'
```
So `node->grad` is what we are passing into `ggml_build_forward_expand`, and we
have seen this function before when we expanded the forward graph.

The backward graph currently looks like this:
```console

(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(gb)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 3
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g
n_leafs = 0
========================================
```
Like we saw before this will visit the parents of the grandient tensor of `a`.
And the first parent of `a` is `b` (which is already in the graph. Next we will
handle src[1] which is the the gradient of `mul`(?) which does not have any
parents so it will complete the for loop and continue with:
```c
    if (node->op == GGML_OP_NONE && node->grad == NULL) {
        // reached a leaf node, not part of the gradient graph (e.g. a constant)
        GGML_ASSERT(cgraph->n_leafs < cgraph->size);

        if (strlen(node->name) == 0) {
            ggml_format_name(node, "leaf_%d", cgraph->n_leafs);
        }

        cgraph->leafs[cgraph->n_leafs] = node;
        cgraph->n_leafs++;
```
This node will be added as a leaf node to the backward graph.
```console
(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(cgraph)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 3
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g
n_leafs = 1
 -   0: [     1,     1]     NONE           leaf_0
========================================
```
That will return and we will be back in `ggml_visit_parents` and we are
currently processing the parents of `a` which only has two parents so it will
continue the loop.
Now, the grandient of `a` is a multiplication operation.
```c
        GGML_ASSERT(cgraph->n_nodes < cgraph->size);

        if (strlen(node->name) == 0) {
            ggml_format_name(node, "node_%d", cgraph->n_nodes);
        }

        cgraph->nodes[cgraph->n_nodes] = node;
        if (cgraph->grads) {
            cgraph->grads[cgraph->n_nodes] = node->grad;
        }
        cgraph->n_nodes++;
    }
```
I wonder if it would b possible/acceptable to add the operations name to the
nodes name? I think it would help with debugging and understanding the graph.
So another node will be added to the graph.
```console
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 4
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x  (a)
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x  (b)
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g  (mul)
 -   3: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g  (node_3)
n_leafs = 1
 -   0: [     1,     1]     NONE           leaf_0
========================================
```
This will return us back in `ggml_build_backward_expand`, which is the loop
over all the nodes in the `forward graph` (gf).
And the forward graphs is unchanged just to confirm this:
```console
(gdb) p ggml_graph_print(gf)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 3
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x (a)
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x (b)
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g (mul)
n_leafs = 0
========================================
```
So now `b`s gradient will be processed just like we did for `a`s gradient.
And we will visit the parents of b's gradient which is `a` and the gradient
of the multiplication operation node. Now, both `a` and the mul grad (leaf_0)
have been added to the backward graph so there is nothing to be done.
The operation is again `GGML_OP_MUL` so we will enter the same block as we did
for the `a` grandient.

```console
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 5
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x (a)
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x (b)
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g (mul)
 -   3: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g (node_3)
 -   4: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g (node_4)
n_leafs = 1
 -   0: [     1,     1]     NONE           leaf_0
========================================
```
After that we will again return to the iteration over the nodes in the forward
graph in `ggml_build_backward_expand`. And the last node to be processed is
`mul`.
```console
    for (int i = 0; i < gf->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = gf->nodes[i];

        if (node->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_PARAM) {
            GGML_PRINT_DEBUG("%s: found root node %p\n", __func__, (void *) node);
            ggml_build_forward_expand(gb, node->grad);
        }
    }
```
But in this case the `mul` node is not a parameter so there will not be any
forward expansion for it.
After that the `zero_table` and `acc_table` will be freed:
```c
    ggml_hash_set_free(&zero_table);
    ggml_hash_set_free(&acc_table);
}
```
And that was the complete `ggml_build_backward_expand` function.

### Graph Compute (Backward)

Now with the backward graph constructed we can actually compute the gradients.
Recall that the backward graph looks like this:
```console
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 5
 -   0: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x (a)
 -   1: [     1,     1,     1]             NONE x (b)
 -   2: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g (mul)
 -   3: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g (node_3)
 -   4: [     1,     1,     1]              MUL g (node_4)
n_leafs = 1
 -   0: [     1,     1]     NONE           leaf_0
========================================
```
First we would compute a loss function and set the output nodes gradient to this
value. In this case I'm just making the value up and setting this as the last
node/tensors gradient:
```c
  ggml_set_f32(mul->grad, 2.0f);
```
Then we will perform the computation by call `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx` just
like we did before for the forward pass, but this time we will be using the
backward graph:
```c
  ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(ctx, b_graph, 1);
```

```c
enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, int n_threads) {
    struct ggml_cplan cplan = ggml_graph_plan(cgraph, n_threads, NULL);

    struct ggml_object * obj = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_WORK_BUFFER, cplan.work_size);

    cplan.work_data = (uint8_t *)ctx->mem_buffer + obj->offs;

    return ggml_graph_compute(cgraph, &cplan);
}
```
So we create a plan and then set a work buffer and then we call
`ggml_graph_compute`.
```c
enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute(struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, struct ggml_cplan * cplan) {
    ...
    } else {
        ggml_graph_compute_thread(&threadpool->workers[0]);
    }
```
I'm skipping the threadpool/threading for now and will revisit that later as
mentioned before.
But lets take a look at the `ggml_graph_compute_thread` function:
```c
static thread_ret_t ggml_graph_compute_thread(void * data) {
    struct ggml_compute_state * state = (struct ggml_compute_state *) data;

    const struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph = state->threadpool->cgraph;
    const struct ggml_cplan  * cplan  = state->threadpool->cplan;

    set_numa_thread_affinity(state->ith);

    struct ggml_compute_params params = {
        /*.ith       =*/ state->ith,
        /*.nth       =*/ state->threadpool->n_threads_cur,
        /*.wsize     =*/ cplan->work_size,
        /*.wdata     =*/ cplan->work_data,
        /*.threadpool=*/ state->threadpool,
    };

    for (int node_n = 0; node_n < cgraph->n_nodes; node_n++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = cgraph->nodes[node_n];

        ggml_compute_forward(&params, node);

        if (state->ith == 0 && cplan->abort_callback && cplan->abort_callback(cplan->abort_callback_data)) {
            state->threadpool->ec = GGML_STATUS_ABORTED;
        }

        ggml_barrier(state->threadpool);

        if (state->threadpool->ec != GGML_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
After creating the compute params the main look is iterating over all the nodes
in the graph:
```c
    for (int node_n = 0; node_n < cgraph->n_nodes; node_n++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = cgraph->nodes[node_n];

        ggml_compute_forward(&params, node);

        if (state->ith == 0 && cplan->abort_callback && cplan->abort_callback(cplan->abort_callback_data)) {
            state->threadpool->ec = GGML_STATUS_ABORTED;
        }

        ggml_barrier(state->threadpool);

        if (state->threadpool->ec != GGML_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
            break;
        }
    }
```
So we have 5 notes in total in our graph (see graph printout above). We are
going iterator over them in order so node `a` will be first:
`ggml_compute_forward`.
```console
(gdb) p node->name
$11 = "a"
(gdb) p node->op
$10 = GGML_OP_NONE
```
And this will be passed to `ggml_compute_forward`:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward(struct ggml_compute_params * params, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    GGML_ASSERT(params);

    if (tensor->op == GGML_OP_NONE || ggml_is_empty(tensor)) {
        return;
    }
```
Notice that in this case `a` does not have an operation so this will just
return at this point.
The same will happen for `b`.

After that we have the `mul` node:
```console
(gdb) p node->name
$17 = "mul", '\000' <repeats 60 times>
(gdb) p node->op
$18 = GGML_OP_MUL
```
This time we will reach the switch statement as the mul tensor has an operation:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward(struct ggml_compute_params * params, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    GGML_ASSERT(params);

    if (tensor->op == GGML_OP_NONE || ggml_is_empty(tensor)) {
        return;
    }

    switch (tensor->op) {
        ...
        case GGML_OP_MUL:
            {
                ggml_compute_forward_mul(params, tensor);
            } break;
        ...
    }
```
So dst will be the mul tensor, and src0 and src1 the a and b tensors in the
following function:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward_mul(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
        struct ggml_tensor * dst) {

    const struct ggml_tensor * src0 = dst->src[0];
    const struct ggml_tensor * src1 = dst->src[1];

    GGML_ASSERT(src1->type == GGML_TYPE_F32 && "only f32 src1 supported for now");

    switch (src0->type) {
        case GGML_TYPE_F32:
            {
                ggml_compute_forward_mul_f32(params, dst);
            } break;
        default:
            {
                GGML_ABORT("fatal error");
            }
    }
}
```

```c
static void ggml_compute_forward_mul_f32(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
        struct ggml_tensor * dst) {

    const struct ggml_tensor * src0 = dst->src[0];
    const struct ggml_tensor * src1 = dst->src[1];

    const int ith = params->ith;  // 0
    const int nth = params->nth;  // 1 (only using one thread for this example)

    const int64_t nr = ggml_nrows(src0);

    GGML_TENSOR_BINARY_OP_LOCALS

    if (nb10 == sizeof(float)) {
```
The above is checking if nb10 (number of bytes) which is the first dimension of
the second source which is `b` in our case:
```console
(gdb) p src1->nb[0]
$32 = 4
(gdb) p nb10
$33 = 4
(gdb) p nb10 == sizeof(float)
$36 = 1
```
So we will enter this if block:
Now, we can see that `ir` is set to the thread index (0 in this specific case
as we are only using 1 thread).

Now, in GGML there are always 4 dimension, or there can be 4 dimensions so this
has to be taken into account.
```c
        for (int64_t ir = ith; ir < nr; ir += nth) {
            // src0 and dst are same shape => same indices
            const int64_t i03 = ir/(ne02*ne01);
            const int64_t i02 = (ir - i03*ne02*ne01)/ne01;
            const int64_t i01 = (ir - i03*ne02*ne01 - i02*ne01);
```
Now, `ir` is the thread index that this thread is responsible for computing.
This is zero in our case. And notice that the above code is only using `ne0` so
this is the src0 tensor (a), see [GGML_TENSOR_BINARY_OP_LOCALS](#GGML_TENSOR_BINARY_OP_LOCALS)
for details about this macro.

And only the "last" three dimensions are used in the above code.
```
    ne00 ne01 ne02 ne03
a: [  1    1    1    1 ]
```
The `ne02 * ne01` is multiplying the number of rows (ne01) by the number of
z-dimensions.
In our case `i03` will become 0 as we only have one thread.

I want to try to visualize this and I want to step away from the current example
and think about a tensor with 4 dimensions with a different shape that the
current example:
```
        x  y  z  w
       [3  2  2  2]
              
 +----------w0----------+
 |  +-------z0-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [0, 1,  2] y0|  |
 |  |   [3, 4,  5] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [ 6, 7, 8] y0|  |
 |  |   [ 9,10,11] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+

 +----------w1----------+       
 |  +-------z0-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [12,13,14] y0|  |
 |  |   [15,16,17] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [18,19,20] y0|  |
 |  |   [21,22,23] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+

x = (ne[0] = 3 columns) 
y = (ne01 = 2 rows)               (i01 in ggml code)
z = (ne02 = 2 z depth)            (i02 in ggml code)
w = (ne03 = 2 w groups)           (i03 in ggml code)

Total elements: 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24
```
What I'm trying to convey here a way to visualize this tensor with 4 dimensions.
We have the inner dimensions which is a 3x2 (3 columns (x) and two rows (y)),
and we have two (z) of these. And we have 1 (w) of z groups. Something like that.

Now, this is how I think of these but this would really stored in memory as a
an array:
```
Memory layout:
  [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23]
```
Now, if we map this back to what the code in ggml is doing:
```c
ir = 1

        x   y     z    w
           ne01  ne02 ne03
       [3   2     2    2]
    const int64_t i03 = ir/(ne02*ne01);
    const int64_t i03 =  1/(   2*2);
    const int64_t i03 =  0
```
And `i03` is the index into w so this would be `w0` in our diagram/image above.
```
  i03 ------+
            ↓
 +----------w0----------+
 |  +-------z0-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [0, 1,  2] y0|  |
 |  |   [3, 4,  5] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [ 6, 7, 8] y0|  |
 |  |   [ 9,10,11] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+
```
Nex we have `i02`:
```c
    const int64_t i02 = (ir - i03*ne02*ne01)/ne01;
    const int64_t i02 = ( 1 -  0 *  2 * 2  )/  2 ;
    const int64_t i02 = (1 -  0 *  2 * 2  )/  2 ;
    const int64_t i02 = 0
```
So `i02` is the index into z.
```
  i03 ------+
            ↓
 +----------w0----------+
 |  +-------z0-------+←-|-------i02 (pointing to z0)
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [0, 1,  2] y0|  |
 |  |   [3, 4,  5] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [ 6, 7, 8] y0|  |
 |  |   [ 9,10,11] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+
```
And after that we have `i01`:
```
    const int64_t i01 = (ir - i03*ne02*ne01 - i02*ne01);
    const int64_t i01 = (1  -  0 * 2  * 2   -  0 * 2  );
    const int64_t i01 = 1
```
So `i01` is the index "into" y:
```
  i03 ------+
            ↓
 +----------w0----------+
 |  +-------z0-------+←-|-------i02 (pointing to z0)
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [0, 1,  2] y0|  |
 |  |   [3, 4,  5] y1|←-|-------i01 (pointing to y1)
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [ 6, 7, 8] y0|  |
 |  |   [ 9,10,11] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+
```
Now that is our visual but memory is still layed out as:
```
Memory layout:
  [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23]

   ne00  ne01  ne02 ne03
   [3     2     2    2]

i03 = 0
i02 = 0
i01 = 1

row_index = i03 * (ne02 * ne01) + i02 * ne01 + i01
          =  0  * (  2  *  2  ) +  0  *  2   + 1
          =  1

Memory Layout (showing row starts):
[0, 1, 2, | 3, 4, 5, | 6, 7, 8, | 9, 10, 11, | 12, 13, 14, | 15, 16, 17, | 18, 19, 20, | 21, 22, 23]
 ^         ^         ^          ^             ^             ^             ^             ^
 |         |         |          |             |             |             |             |
 Row 0     Row 1     Row 2      Row 3         Row 4         Row 5         Row 6         Row 7
```
Next we have the following which is using ne1 which is src1 and in our case
the b tensor:
```c
            const int64_t i13 = i03 % ne13;
            const int64_t i12 = i02 % ne12;
            const int64_t i11 = i01 % ne11;
```
This is broadscasting the b tensor to match the shape of the a tensor. So i13
handles broadcasting for the w dimension, i12 for the z dimension, and i11 for
the y dimension. Lets look at an example:
```
src0 shape: [3, 2, 2, 2] (ne00, ne01, ne02, ne03)

 +----------w0----------+
 |  +-------z0-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [0, 1,  2] y0|  |
 |  |   [3, 4,  5] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [ 6, 7, 8] y0|  |
 |  |   [ 9,10,11] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+

 +----------w1----------+       
 |  +-------z0-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [12,13,14] y0|  |
 |  |   [15,16,17] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [18,19,20] y0|  |
 |  |   [21,22,23] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+

src1 shape: [3, 1, 2, 1] (ne10, ne11, ne12, ne13)
 +----------w0----------+
 |  +-------z0-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [0, 1,  2] y0|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 |                      |
 |  +-------z1-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |
 |  |   [ 3, 4, 5] y0|  |
 |  +----------------+  |
 +----------------------+

    const int64_t i13 = i03 % ne13;
    const int64_t i13 = 0   % 1;
    const int64_t i13 = 0;
```
So we can see that src1 only has one element in the w dimension so this will
be broadcasted, that is the first element of w in src1 will be "duplicated".
And the same will happen for the y dimension which is also different.
```

|  |   [3, 4,  5] y0|  |
|  |   [3, 4,  5] y1|  |
|  +----------------+  |
+----------------------+
```

Following that we have create a pointer to the destination tensors data:
```c
float * dst_ptr  = (float *) ((char *) dst->data  + i03*nb3  + i02*nb2  + i01*nb1 );
```
And this is using the i03, i02, and i01 to calculate the index into the data
and it is using the strides (nb) for the respective dimensions.
And the same is done for the src0 and src1 tensors:
```c
float * src0_ptr = (float *) ((char *) src0->data + i03*nb03 + i02*nb02 + i01*nb01);
float * src1_ptr = (float *) ((char *) src1->data + i13*nb13 + i12*nb12 + i11*nb11);
```
Next we will iterate over all rows of nr
```c
    const int64_t nr0 = ne00 / ne10;
```
Now, `ne00` is the number of elements of the innermost dimension of src0 and
`ne10` is the number of elements in the innermost dimension of src1. So nr0
will be the number of times src1's innermost dimension needs to be repeated as
part of the broadcasting. If these are the same then nr0 will be 1. If src0 is
greater than src1 then nr0 will be greater than 1. For example 4/2 = 2.
This will then be used for the following loop:
```c
    for (int64_t r = 0 ; r < nr0; ++r) {
        ggml_vec_mul_f32(ne10, dst_ptr + r*ne10, src0_ptr + r*ne10, src1_ptr);
    }
```
Lets start with the first argument which is `ne10` and we know that this is
the number of elements of the src1 tensors first dimension. So this is the
number of element to multiply.
```console
(gdb) p ne10
$70 = 1
```
Next we have the destination pointer, and then the src0 pointer and the src1
pointer. Notice that the src1 pointer is not incremented as it does not change
even if broadcasting is done, the same elements are used.
We can visualize this with the following example:
```
nr0 = 2, ne10 = 2:

Memory layout:
src0: [a, b, c, d]
src1: [x, y]
dst:  [_, _, _, _] (before mul operation)

Iteration 1 (r = 0):
  src0_ptr + 0*ne10 → [a, b]
  src1_ptr          → [x, y]
  dst_ptr  + 0*ne10 → [a*x, b*y, _, _]

Iteration 2 (r = 1):
  src0_ptr + 1*ne10 → [c, d]
  src1_ptr          → [x, y]
  dst_ptr  + 1*ne10 → [a*x, b*y, c*x, d*y]

Result: dst = [a*x, b*y, c*x, d*y]
```

```c
inline static void ggml_vec_mul_f32(const int n,
                                    float * z,
                                    const float * x,
                                    const float * y) {
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        z[i]  = x[i]*y[i];
        }
}
```

And that is pretty much it.
TODO: Create an example that has 4 dimension like the visualizations above
and also requires broadcasting, that is the dimensions for a and b should
differ.

Then we have `node_n` which will now be 3:
```console
(gdb) p *node
$141 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0,
ne = {1, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 4, 4, 4}, op = GGML_OP_MUL,
op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x7ffff6a28ff0,
src = {0x7ffff6a00330, 0x7ffff6a007b0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a28fc0, name = "node_3", '\000' <repeats 57 times>,
extra = 0x0}
```
And this is the gradient for `a`. But how do we know that. Well one way to
figure this out is to look at the source tensors for this node:
```console
gdb) p node->src[0]->name
$143 = "b", '\000' <repeats 62 times>
(gdb) p node->src[1]->name
$150 = "leaf_0", '\000' <repeats 57 times>

```
And we can verify this by looking at the source tensor `a`:
```console
(gdb) p cgraph->nodes[0]->name
$144 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>

(gdb) p cgraph->nodes[0]->grad
$145 = (struct ggml_tensor *) 0x7ffff6a28e70
(gdb) p node
$146 = (struct ggml_tensor *) 0x7ffff6a28e70
```
So we will call `ggml_compute_forward` with this tensor (that gradient for a
that is) and this is a `GGML_OP_MUL` so it is an operation.
So this will multiply the gradient of mul with b which is caculating the
derivative for a.
```console
(gdb) p *(float*)src0->data
$155 = 3
(gdb) p *(float*)src1->data
$154 = 2
```
Recall what we set `ggml_set_f32(mul->grad, 2.0f)` and b is 3.
And after the multiplication:
```console
(gdb) p *(float*)dst->data
$158 = 6
```
Next will be node 4:
```console
(gdb) p *node
$161 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0,
ne = {1, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 4, 4, 4}, op = GGML_OP_MUL,
op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x7ffff6a292f0,
src = {0x7ffff6a00030, 0x7ffff6a007b0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a292c0,
name = "node_4", '\000' <repeats 57 times>,
extra = 0x0}
```
This is also a `GGML_OP_MUL` and the source tensors are `a` and `leaf_0`:
```console
(gdb) p node->src[0]->name
$162 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>
(gdb) p node->src[1]->name
$163 = "leaf_0", '\000' <repeats 57 times>
```
So this is the operation for calculating the derivative for `b`.

### Broadcasting
Broadcasting is a set of rules for how to handle operations between arrays of
different shapes which is not specific to ML or neural networks.

Lets take a normal matrix vector multiplication as an example:
```
Matrix A (shape 3x2):  (using ggml dimension "notation" so x is the first dim)
[1  2  3]
[4  5  6]

Vector b (shape 3x1):
[10  20  30]

Transposed:
[10]
[20]
[30]

[1  2  3]  [10]  = [1 * 10 + 2 * 20 + 3 * 30] =  [140]
[4  5  6]  [20]    [4 * 10 + 5 * 20 + 6 * 30]    [320]
           [30]    [10 * 10 + 20 * 20 + 30 * 30] [1400]
```
There is no problem multiplying these as the dimensions match up. But what if
b was 2x1 instead:
```
Matrix A (shape 3x2):  (using ggml dimension "notation" so x is the first dim)
[1  2  3]
[4  5  6]

Vector b (shape 2x1):
[10  20 ]

[1  2  3]  [10]  Not possible due to dimension missmatch. 
[4  5  6]  [20]
```
We can think of the a matrix as a matrix of 2 rows and each row is like a function that
takes 3 arguments. So call a function we have to provide the right number of arguments
just like calling a function in programming.
So broadcasting is a way to make the dimensions match up so that we can perform the
operation. For example:
```
Vector b (shape 2x1):
[10  20 ]  -> [10  20 1]

[1  2  3]  [10]  = [1 * 10 + 2 * 20 + 3 * 1] =  [53]
[4  5  6]  [20]    [4 * 10 + 5 * 20 + 6 * 1]    [146]
```
So be is extened with 1 (the identity element for multiplication).
There is an example of broadcasting in [braodcast_manual.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/broadcast_manual.c)
which might help to explore this idea more.

One thing to note is that how the vector, like b above, is extended can be different for
different operations. For multiplication it might be appropriate to extend the vector
with 1s but for other operations it might be different. I'll try to go through and addition
operation too later to see how this is handled.

The following is using the ggml example [braodcast.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/broadcast.c)
for debugging:
```c
  struct ggml_tensor* a = ggml_new_tensor_4d(ctx, GGML_TYPE_F32, 3, 2, 2, 2);
  struct ggml_tensor* b = ggml_new_tensor_4d(ctx, GGML_TYPE_F32, 3, 1, 2, 1);
  struct ggml_tensor* mul = ggml_mul(ctx, a, b);
```
```
a (src0) shape: [3, 2, 2, 2] (ne00, ne01, ne02, ne03)

 |  |   [21,22,23] y1|  |
 |  +----------------+  |

 |  +-------z0-------+  |
 |  |    x0 x1 x2    |  |

```
If we set a breakpoint in `ggml_compute_forward_mul_f32` we can see the
following:
```c
    const int64_t nr = ggml_nrows(src0);
```
```console
(gdb) p ggml_nrows(src0)
$5 = 8
```
Now, ggml_nrows only takes the last three dimensions into account:
```c
int64_t ggml_nrows(const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    return tensor->ne[1]*tensor->ne[2]*tensor->ne[3];
}
```
The total number of elements in a/src0 is 3 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 24, and the number
of rows will be 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.
```
Memory Layout (showing row starts):
[0, 1, 2, | 3, 4, 5, | 6, 7, 8, | 9, 10, 11, | 12, 13, 14, | 15, 16, 17, | 18, 19, 20, | 21, 22, 23]
 ^         ^         ^          ^             ^             ^             ^             ^
 |         |         |          |             |             |             |             |
 Row 0     Row 1     Row 2      Row 3         Row 4         Row 5         Row 6         Row 7
```
This is the number of rows what we will be iterating over (I'm skipping over
some of the details here that we convered priviously):
```
        for (int64_t ir = ith; ir < nr; ir += nth) {
            ...
            for (int64_t r = 0 ; r < nr0; ++r) {
                ggml_vec_mul_f32(ne10, dst_ptr + r*ne10, src0_ptr + r*ne10, src1_ptr);
            }
```
Now, we can expect broadcasting to happen for the y and z dimension as these
are smaller for the b/src1 tensor. 
So lets set a conditional breakpoint for i01, which is for the y dimension:
```console
(gdb) br ggml.c:10578 if i01 > 0
(gdb) r
```
At this point src0_ptr is:
```console
(gdb) p *src0_ptr
$18 = 4

(gdb) p ((float*)dst->data)[0]
$12 = 1
(gdb) p ((float*)dst->data)[1]
$13 = 4
(gdb) p ((float*)dst->data)[2]
$14 = 9
(gdb) p ((float*)dst->data)[3]
$15 = 0
```
So we have already multiplied the first row of a/src0 with the first row of
b/src1. And we can see that the first row of dst is [1, 4, 9]. Now src1/b does
not have a second row to multiply so the same row will be used:
```console
(gdb) p src1_ptr[0]
$20 = 1
(gdb) p src1_ptr[1]
$21 = 2
(gdb) p src1_ptr[2]
$22 = 3

(gdb) p ne10
$23 = 3
```
After the multiplication we can see that the second row of dst is:
```console
(gdb) p dst_ptr[0]
$34 = 4                 (4 * 1)
(gdb) p dst_ptr[1]    
$35 = 10                (5 * 2)
(gdb) p dst_ptr[2]
$36 = 18                (6 * 3)
```
Perhaps it would be interesting to see how broadcasting is done for tensors
that also differ in the x dimension or perhaps only in that dimension.

_wip_

Now, recall that we are iterating over all the 8 rows in a/src0. If there is
a missmatch of dimension size (other than the first dimension) then the above
will just use the first element of the smaller tensor.

### GGML_TENSOR_BINARY_OP_LOCALS
`GGML_TENSOR_BINARY_OP_LOCALS` expands local variables for the src tensors and
this is used in many if not all the operation functions so it can be good to
understand/know about them as it will make reading the code easier (otherwise
it just looks like variables are magically being used)
```c
    const int64_t ne00 = (src0)->ne[0];
    const int64_t ne01 = (src0)->ne[1];
    const int64_t ne02 = (src0)->ne[2];
    const int64_t ne03 = (src0)->ne[3];

    const size_t nb00 = (src0)->nb[0];
    const size_t nb01 = (src0)->nb[1];
    const size_t nb02 = (src0)->nb[2];
    const size_t nb03 = (src0)->nb[3];

    const int64_t ne10 = (src1)->ne[0];
    const int64_t ne11 = (src1)->ne[1];
    const int64_t ne12 = (src1)->ne[2];
    const int64_t ne13 = (src1)->ne[3];

    const size_t nb10 = (src1)->nb[0];
    const size_t nb11 = (src1)->nb[1];
    const size_t nb12 = (src1)->nb[2];
    const size_t nb13 = (src1)->nb[3];

    const int64_t ne0 = (dst)->ne[0];
    const int64_t ne1 = (dst)->ne[1];
    const int64_t ne2 = (dst)->ne[2];
    const int64_t ne3 = (dst)->ne[3];

    const size_t nb0 = (dst)->nb[0];
    const size_t nb1 = (dst)->nb[1];
    const size_t nb2 = (dst)->nb[2];
    const size_t nb3 = (dst)->nb[3];
```
There are also casts are just to avoid warnings about unused variables which
I've removed for clarity here.
Notice the pattern here that is used. For the source tensor we have `ne` for
number of elements and `nb` for number of bytes (stride), followed the source
index (src0, src1 etc), and then the dimension index.
For the destination tensor (mul in this case), these are named only using
ne and nb followed by the dimension index (there is only one dst tensor).

### `ggml_get_rows`
```c
GGML_CALL int64_t ggml_nrows(const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    static_assert(GGML_MAX_DIMS == 4, "GGML_MAX_DIMS is not 4 - update this function");

    return tensor->ne[1]*tensor->ne[2]*tensor->ne[3];
}
```
Notice that for a 2d case we have d0 which are the number of elements, and d1
is the number of rows. For more dimensions we have d1*d2 rows and so on. This
is basically what the above is caclulating.



And notice that the operation is of type `GGML_OP_MUL_MAT`.
```
        switch (node->op) {
        ...
            case GGML_OP_MUL_MAT:
                {
                    const enum ggml_type vec_dot_type = type_traits[node->src[0]->type].vec_dot_type;

                    if (node->src[1]->type != vec_dot_type) {
                        cur = ggml_row_size(vec_dot_type, ggml_nelements(node->src[1]));
                    }
                } break;
```
`type_traits` is an array of struct that has the following members:
```console
(gdb) ptype ggml_type_traits_t
type = struct {
    const char *type_name;
    int blck_size;
    size_t type_size;
    _Bool is_quantized;
    ggml_to_float_t to_float;
    ggml_from_float_t from_float;
    ggml_from_float_t from_float_reference;
    ggml_vec_dot_t vec_dot;
    enum ggml_type vec_dot_type;
    int64_t nrows;
}
(gdb) p node->src[0]->type
$49 = GGML_TYPE_F32

(gdb) p type_traits[node->src[0]->type]
$50 = {type_name = 0x5555555ea428 "f32", blck_size = 1, type_size = 4, is_quantized = false, to_float = 0x0, from_float = 0x0, 
  from_float_reference = 0x0, vec_dot = 0x55555555a0ed <ggml_vec_dot_f32>, vec_dot_type = GGML_TYPE_F32, nrows = 1}
(gdb) p type_traits[node->src[0]->type].vec_dot_type
$51 = GGML_TYPE_F32
```
Notice that the above is checking the types of the parent/src nodes and if they
are the same type, which is the case here, then it will not set `cur`.
```c
    cplan.n_threads = MIN(max_tasks, n_threads);
    cplan.work_size = work_size;   // 0 
    cplan.work_data = NULL;       

    return cplan;
```
Back in `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx` we  have created the cplan and will now
create a new object of type `GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_WORK_BUFFER`.
```c
enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, int n_threads) {
    struct ggml_cplan cplan = ggml_graph_plan(cgraph, n_threads);

    struct ggml_object * obj = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_WORK_BUFFER, cplan.work_size);

    cplan.work_data = (uint8_t *)ctx->mem_buffer + obj->offs;

    return ggml_graph_compute(cgraph, &cplan);
}
```
I've gone through `ggml_new_object` before so I won't go through it again.
TODO: look into the context `mem_buffer` and how that works.

So lets now take a look at `ggml_graph_compute`:

```

```
        #pragma omp parallel num_threads(n_threads)
```
This is an OpenMP directive that specifies that the following block of code
should be executed in parallel by `n_threads`. So this will start 4 threads in
our case.

The next OMP directive is `#pragma omp single` which specifies that the block
should be executed by a single thread. So one of those four threads will execute
the block of code that follows, which in this case just gets the number of
threads from OpenMP and sets the `n_threads` to that value.

If we set a breakpoint in the single block and the parallel block we can
inspect the threads that have been created:
```console

(gdb) p n_threads
$66 = 4
```
And we can switch between the threads using:
```console
(gdb) thread 1
[Switching to thread 1 (Thread 0x7ffff7e65c00 (LWP 80908))]
#0  0x00007ffff7e8b0ca in ?? () from /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libgomp.so.1
```
But lets follow thread 1 in this case:
```c
            struct ggml_compute_state worker = {
                .thrd   = 0,
                .ith    = omp_get_thread_num(),
                .shared = &state_shared,
            };
            ggml_graph_compute_thread(&worker);
```
```console
(gdb) thread 1
(gdb) set scheduler-locking on
```

So we will call `ggml_graph_compute_thread` with the worker struct:
```c
static thread_ret_t ggml_graph_compute_thread(void * data) {
    struct ggml_compute_state * state = (struct ggml_compute_state *) data;

    const struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph = state->shared->cgraph;
    const struct ggml_cplan  * cplan  = state->shared->cplan;

    set_numa_thread_affinity(state->ith);

    struct ggml_compute_params params = {
        /*.ith   =*/ state->ith,
        /*.nth   =*/ state->shared->n_threads,
        /*.wsize =*/ cplan->work_size,
        /*.wdata =*/ cplan->work_data,
        /*.shared=*/ state->shared,
    };

    for (int node_n = 0; node_n < cgraph->n_nodes; node_n++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = cgraph->nodes[node_n];

        ggml_compute_forward(&params, node);

        if (state->ith == 0 && cplan->abort_callback && cplan->abort_callback(cplan->abort_callback_data)) {
            state->shared->ec = GGML_STATUS_ABORTED;
        }

        ggml_barrier(state->shared);

        if (state->shared->ec != GGML_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
So this is looping over all the nodes in the compute graph, which is only one
in this case.
```console
(gdb) p *node
$71 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0, ne = {3, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 12, 12, 12}, 
  op = GGML_OP_MUL_MAT, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x7ffff6bff030, 0x7ffff6bff1c0, 0x0, 0x0, 
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6bff490, name = "result", '\000' <repeats 57 times>, 
  extra = 0x0}
```
And then calling `ggml_compute_forward`:

```c
static void ggml_compute_forward(struct ggml_compute_params * params, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    GGML_ASSERT(params);

    if (tensor->op == GGML_OP_NONE || ggml_is_empty(tensor)) {
        return;
    }

    switch (tensor->op) {
        ...
        case GGML_OP_MUL_MAT:
            {
                ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat(params, tensor);
            } break;
        ...
```

```
static void ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
              struct ggml_tensor * dst) {

    const struct ggml_tensor * src0 = dst->src[0];
    const struct ggml_tensor * src1 = dst->src[1];

    GGML_TENSOR_BINARY_OP_LOCALS

    const int ith = params->ith;  // index of thread
    const int nth = params->nth;  // number of threads

    const enum ggml_type type = src0->type;

    enum ggml_type    const vec_dot_type          = type_traits[type].vec_dot_type;
    ggml_from_float_t const from_float_to_vec_dot = type_traits[vec_dot_type].from_float;
    int64_t           const vec_dot_num_rows      = type_traits[type].nrows;
```
So we have our two src tensors which are 'a' anb 'b'

`GGML_TENSOR_BINARY_OP_LOCALS` expands local variables for the src tensors and
are used later in the funcion:
```c
    const int64_t ne00 = (src0)->ne[0];
    (void)(ne00);
    const int64_t ne01 = (src0)->ne[1];
    (void)(ne01);
    const int64_t ne02 = (src0)->ne[2];
    (void)(ne02);
    const int64_t ne03 = (src0)->ne[3];
    (void)(ne03);
    const size_t nb00 = (src0)->nb[0];
    (void)(nb00);
    const size_t nb01 = (src0)->nb[1];
    (void)(nb01);
    const size_t nb02 = (src0)->nb[2]; (void)(nb02); const size_t nb03 = (src0)->nb[3]; (void)(nb03); const int64_t ne10 = (src1)->ne[0]; (void)(ne10); const int64_t ne11 = (src1)->ne[1]; (void)(ne11); const int64_t ne12 = (src1)->ne[2]; (void)(ne12); const int64_t ne13 = (src1)->ne[3]; (void)(ne13); const size_t nb10 = (src1)->nb[0]; (void)(nb10); const size_t nb11 = (src1)->nb[1]; (void)(nb11); const size_t nb12 = (src1)->nb[2]; (void)(nb12); const size_t nb13 = (src1)->nb[3]; (void)(nb13); const int64_t ne0 = (dst)->ne[0]; (void)(ne0); const int64_t ne1 = (dst)->ne[1]; (void)(ne1); const int64_t ne2 = (dst)->ne[2]; (void)(ne2); const int64_t ne3 = (dst)->ne[3]; (void)(ne3); const size_t nb0 = (dst)->nb[0]; (void)(nb0); const size_t nb1 = (dst)->nb[1]; (void)(nb1); const size_t nb2 = (dst)->nb[2]; (void)(nb2); const size_t nb3 = (dst)->nb[3]; (void)(nb3);
```
Next we have:
```c
    if (ith == 0) {
        // Every thread starts at ith, so the first unprocessed chunk is nth.  This save a bit of coordination right at the start.
        atomic_store(&params->shared->current_chunk, nth);
    }

    ggml_barrier(params->shared);
```
Now, ith is the index of the thread and this is checking that it is 0.
The `atomic_store` functions is not compiled in on Linux and may be specific to
Windows. TODO: figure out how this is done. 
Then we have `ggml_barrier`:
```c
static void ggml_barrier(struct ggml_compute_state_shared * shared) {
    if (shared->n_threads == 1) {
        return;
    }

    #pragma omp barrier
}
```
When a thread reaches this point in the code, it must wait until all other
threads in the team reach the same point. Only when all threads have arrived at
the barrier can they all proceed. 

```

```

Now, the `ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat` function is inside of a omp parallel
block so mulitple threads will be running this function.
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
              struct ggml_tensor * dst) {

```
So thread usage in GGML is using in a way that is kind of similar to how CUDA
kernels are executed as well, the same function runs but by different threads.
This enables compution on the same matrix but using different pieces of the
data. Take matrix multiplication for example which performs the dot product.
The dot product to the resulting output matrix, position 0,0 is the dot product
of the first row of the first matrix and the first column of the second matrix.
This can be handled by one thread.

### Threading
This section will look at how threading is used/implemented in GGML.

Lets take any of the exploration examples in [ggml](../fundamentals/ggml) and
and set a breakpoint in the `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx` function. I'll use
the `rope` example just because its the last one I worked on:
```console
$ gdb --args bin/rope
(gdb) br ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx
(gdb) r
Breakpoint 1, ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx (ctx=0x55555568a808 <g_state+8>, cgraph=0x7ffff691d610, n_threads=4) at /home/danbev/work/ai/learning-ai/fundamentals/ggml/ggml/src/ggml.c:18771
18771	enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, int n_threads) {
```
We can see that this functions takes a `ggml_context` which we have talked about
previously, and also a computation graph, and the number of threads to use.
```c
enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, int n_threads) {
    struct ggml_cplan cplan = ggml_graph_plan(cgraph, n_threads);

    struct ggml_object * obj = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_WORK_BUFFER, cplan.work_size);

    cplan.work_data = (uint8_t *)ctx->mem_buffer + obj->offs;

    return ggml_graph_compute(cgraph, &cplan);
}
```
TOOD: look into the context `mem_buffer` and how that works.

First the construction of a `ggml_cplan` will happen, which is a struct that
looks like this:
```console
(gdb) ptype struct ggml_cplan
type = struct ggml_cplan {
    size_t work_size;
    uint8_t *work_data;
    int n_threads;
    ggml_abort_callback abort_callback;
    void *abort_callback_data;
}
```
We can see that is `n_threads` is not set then the default will be used which is
currently 4.
```c
struct ggml_cplan ggml_graph_plan(const struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, int n_threads) {
    if (n_threads <= 0) {
        n_threads = GGML_DEFAULT_N_THREADS;
    }
```
This function will iterate over all the nodes in the compute graph which is
2 in our case:
```console
    for (int i = 0; i < cgraph->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = cgraph->nodes[i];
        ...
    }
```
```console
(gdb) p cgraph->n_nodes
$1 = 2
```
And notice that a node is just a tensor:
```console
(gdb) p *node
$3 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0, ne = {128, 32, 6, 1}, nb = {4, 512, 16384, 98304}, 
op = GGML_OP_RESHAPE, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x7ffff68ed030, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 
0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x7ffff68ed030, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff68ed180, name = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>, extra = 0x0}
```
Following that we have this line:
```c
        const int n_tasks = ggml_get_n_tasks(node, n_threads);
```
Note that the operation of the tensor is `GGML_OP_RESHAPE`:
```c
static int ggml_get_n_tasks(struct ggml_tensor * node, int n_threads) {
    int n_tasks = 0;

    if (ggml_is_empty(node)) {
        // no need to multi-thread a no-op
        n_tasks = 1;
        return n_tasks;
    }

    switch (node->op) {
      ...
        case GGML_OP_SCALE:
        case GGML_OP_SET:
        case GGML_OP_RESHAPE:
        case GGML_OP_VIEW:
        case GGML_OP_PERMUTE:
        case GGML_OP_TRANSPOSE:
        case GGML_OP_GET_ROWS_BACK:
        case GGML_OP_DIAG:
            {
                n_tasks = 1;
            } break;
    }
```
So in this case `n_tasks` will be set to 1. And this will be returned. Reshape is
actually a no-operation in the forward pass:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward_reshape(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
        struct ggml_tensor * dst) {
    // NOP
    UNUSED(params);
    UNUSED(dst);
}
```

Back in `ggml_graph_plan` there is a switch statement in the for loop over
the nodes in the compute graph:
```c
        switch (node->op) {
            ...
            default:
                break;
```
But for the current operation, `GGML_OP_RESHAPE` there is no special handling.

For the second node which is the following:
```console
(gdb) p node->op
$12 = GGML_OP_ROPE
```
For this operation `n_tasks` will be set to the number of threads:
```c
        case GGML_OP_ROPE:
        case GGML_OP_ROPE_BACK:
        case GGML_OP_ADD_REL_POS:
            {
                n_tasks = n_threads;
            } break;
```
And this will then be returned.

Again back in the for loop in `ggml_graph_plan` this time there is a case for
`GGML_OP_ROPE`:
```c
    size_t work_size = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i < cgraph->n_nodes; i++) {
        ...
        size_t cur = 0;

        switch (node->op) {
            ...
            case GGML_OP_ROPE:
                {
                    cur = ggml_type_size(GGML_TYPE_F32) * node->ne[0] * n_tasks;
                } break;
        }
    }

    if (work_size > 0) {
        work_size += CACHE_LINE_SIZE*(n_threads - 1);
    }

    cplan.n_threads = MIN(max_tasks, n_threads);
    cplan.work_size = work_size;
    cplan.work_data = NULL;

    return cplan;
```
We can inspect the values for the calculation of `cur`:
```console
(gdb) p node->ne[0]
$14 = 128
(gdb) p ggml_type_size(GGML_TYPE_F32)
$15 = 4
(gdb) p ggml_type_size(GGML_TYPE_F32) * node->ne[0] * n_tasks
$16 = 2048
```
So `work_size` will be set to 2048 in this case, which will later be extended
to make sure that different threads are not writing to the same cache line
(false sharing). The first thread does not need this spacing as it typically
starts at the base address. This will allow each thread to operate on different
cache lines.

Our `cplan` struct will then look like this:
```console
(gdb) p cplan
$20 = {work_size = 2240, work_data = 0x0, n_threads = 4, abort_callback = 0x0, abort_callback_data = 0x0}
```
This will then be retuned to `ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx`:
```c
enum ggml_status ggml_graph_compute_with_ctx(struct ggml_context * ctx, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph, int n_threads) {
    struct ggml_cplan cplan = ggml_graph_plan(cgraph, n_threads);

    struct ggml_object * obj = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_WORK_BUFFER, cplan.work_size);
    cplan.work_data = (uint8_t *)ctx->mem_buffer + obj->offs;
    return ggml_graph_compute(cgraph, &cplan);
```
GGML currently has three types of objects and I think we have discussed the
other two previously:
```c
    enum ggml_object_type {
        GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_TENSOR,
        GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_GRAPH,
        GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_WORK_BUFFER
    };
```

Lets take a closer look at `ggml_graph_compute`:
```c

            .ith    = 0,
            .shared = &state_shared,
        };
        ggml_graph_compute_thread(&worker);
    }
```
The member `ec`in the `ggml_compute_state_shared` struct is the error code (ec)
which for some reason was not obvious to me initially.

```
        #pragma omp parallel num_threads(n_threads)
```
This is an OpenMP directive that specifies that the following block of code
should be executed in parallel by `n_threads`. So this will start 4 threads in
our case.

The next OMP directive is `#pragma omp single` which specifies that the block
should be executed by a single thread. So one of those four threads will execute
the block of code that follows, which in this case just gets the number of
threads from OpenMP and sets the `n_threads` to that value.

If we set a breakpoint in the single block and the parallel block we can
inspect the threads that have been created:
```console

```
Now, lets enable thread locking:
```console
(gdb) set scheduler-locking on
```
This is the single thread block which will execute and set the
`state_shared.n_threads`:
```c
            #pragma omp single
            {
                // update the number of threads from the actual number of threads that we got from OpenMP
                n_threads = omp_get_num_threads();
                state_shared.n_threads = n_threads;
            }
```
So lets also set a break point in the after the single thread block to be able
to step through it.
```c
            struct ggml_compute_state worker = {
                .thrd   = 0,
                .ith    = omp_get_thread_num(),
                .shared = &state_shared,
            };
            ggml_graph_compute_thread(&worker);
```
So the above will get executed by each thread and each will set teh `ith` member
of the `ggml_compute_state` struct to the thread number. For example the current
thread will set it to 3:
```console
(gdb) p (int) omp_get_thread_num()
$23 = 3
```
Note that `thrd` is short for `thread` and its type is `ggml_thread_t`:
```console
(gdb) ptype struct ggml_compute_state
type = struct ggml_compute_state {
    ggml_thread_t thrd;
    int ith;
    struct ggml_compute_state_shared *shared;
}
```
And notice that all `ggml_compute_state`'s will have a pointer to the shared
compute state which contains:
```console
(gdb) p state_shared
$24 = {cgraph = 0x7ffff691d610,
       cplan = 0x7fffffffdd90,
       n_threads = 4,
       n_barrier = 0,
       n_barrier_passed = 0,
       abort_callback = 0x0, 
       abort_callback_data = 0x0,
       current_chunk = 0,
       ec = GGML_STATUS_SUCCESS}
```

After that the worker struct will be passed to `ggml_graph_compute_thread`:
```c
static thread_ret_t ggml_graph_compute_thread(void * data) {
    struct ggml_compute_state * state = (struct ggml_compute_state *) data;

    const struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph = state->shared->cgraph;
    const struct ggml_cplan  * cplan  = state->shared->cplan;

    set_numa_thread_affinity(state->ith);

    struct ggml_compute_params params = {
        /*.ith   =*/ state->ith,
        /*.nth   =*/ state->shared->n_threads,
        /*.wsize =*/ cplan->work_size,
        /*.wdata =*/ cplan->work_data,
        /*.shared=*/ state->shared,
    };

    for (int node_n = 0; node_n < cgraph->n_nodes; node_n++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = cgraph->nodes[node_n];

        ggml_compute_forward(&params, node);

        if (state->ith == 0 && cplan->abort_callback && cplan->abort_callback(cplan->abort_callback_data)) {
            state->shared->ec = GGML_STATUS_ABORTED;
        }

        ggml_barrier(state->shared);

        if (state->shared->ec != GGML_STATUS_SUCCESS) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return 0;
}
```
A `ggml_compute_params` struct is created which contains the thread number (3
in the current session/thread), the number of threads (4), the work size (2240),
the work data, and also a pointer to the shared compute state.

Now, recall that all the threads will execute this function and not just one,
and all of them will loop through the nodes in the compute graph.
And in this case the first node is the rehape tensor which will be passed to
`ggml_compute_forward`:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward(struct ggml_compute_params * params, struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    GGML_ASSERT(params);

    if (tensor->op == GGML_OP_NONE || ggml_is_empty(tensor)) {
        return;
    }

    switch (tensor->op) {
        ...
        case GGML_OP_RESHAPE:
            {
                ggml_compute_forward_reshape(params, tensor);
            } break;
        ...
    }
```
And like we mentioned earlier rehape is a no-operation in the forward pass:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward_reshape(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
        struct ggml_tensor * dst) {
    // NOP
    UNUSED(params);
    UNUSED(dst);
}
```
Back in `ggml_graph_compute_thread` we have the following:
```c
        if (state->ith == 0 && cplan->abort_callback && cplan->abort_callback(cplan->abort_callback_data)) {
            state->shared->ec = GGML_STATUS_ABORTED;
        }

        ggml_barrier(state->shared);
```
In our case/thread the `state->ith` is 3 so that block will only be performed by
thread 0. Next we have the `ggml_barrier` which will a syncrhonization
construct which ensures that all threads in a parallel region (OpenMP block
which we are currently in). So all theads must wait for the others at this
point. For us this means that nothing else will happen as we enabled thread
locking earlier. So lets disable that and continue.
```console
(gdb) set scheduler-locking off
(gdb) continue
```
When we hit the next breakpoint we can inspect the node/tensor to see that it is
the `GGML_OP_ROPE` operation and then again enable thread locking.
What we are interested in is the usage of the params like `ith`
```c
    const int ith = params->ith;  // thread number
    const int nth = params->nth;  // number of threads
```
Next we have the calculation of the number of rows which I'd like to see how it
is implemented:
```c
    const int nr = ggml_nrows(dst);
```
```c
GGML_CALL int64_t ggml_nrows(const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    static_assert(GGML_MAX_DIMS == 4, "GGML_MAX_DIMS is not 4 - update this function");
    return tensor->ne[1] * tensor->ne[2] * tensor->ne[3];
}
```
Our tensor has the following shape:
```console
(gdb) p tensor->ne
$42 = {128, 32, 6, 1}
```
128 is the number of dimensions, 32 the number of heads, 6 is the number of
tokens in the sequence, and 1 is the batch size. So this will become
32 * 6 * 1 = 192 rows.

Next we have the calculation of the number of rows per thread:
```c
    // rows per thread
    const int dr = (nr + nth - 1)/nth;
```
This will become (192 + 4 - 1)/4 = 48. So each thread will handle 48 rows.
We can visualize this something like this:
```
    0                               128
0   [                                 ]  thread 0
                    ...
    [                                 ]
47  [                                 ]  thread 1
                    ...
    [                                 ]  
95  [                                 ]  thread 2
                    ...
    [                                 ]  
143 [                                 ]  thread 3
                    ...
    [                                 ] 
191 [                                 ]
```

```c
    // row range for this thread
    const int ir0 = dr*ith;
    const int ir1 = MIN(ir0 + dr, nr);
```
So `ir0` (index row) will be 48 * 3 = 144.

Next we have a local variable named `ir`:
```c
    // row index used to determine which thread to use
    int ir = 0;
```
I'm going to skip the details of the rope implementation as this has been
covered in [ggml-rope.md](positional-encoding/ggml-rope.md) and focus on the
code related to multithreading.
Below there is an outerloop that loops over the number of batches (which is just
one in this case), then it will loop over the number of tokens in the sequence
which is 6. And the it will loop over the number of heads:
```c
    for (int64_t i3 = 0; i3 < ne3; i3++) {
        for (int64_t i2 = 0; i2 < ne2; i2++) {
            ...
            for (int64_t i1 = 0; i1 < ne1; i1++) {
                if (ir++ < ir0) continue;
                if (ir   > ir1) break;
```
This is the part that is interesting to this section. Recall that `ir` was set
to 0 initially and `ir0` was set to 144 (the rows that this thread is going to
process). So what this is doing is that it contining the loop as long as `ir` 
is not rows that this thread is going to process. And if `ir` has reached `ir1`
then it will break out of the loop. So when the body of the loop is executed i1
will be in the range 143 to 191.
And I think this is how the multi-threading is implemented in GGML.

### Backpropagation
This section deals with the backpropagation in GGML.
The following example [backprop.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/backprop.c) will be used
to explore backpropagation in this section.

First lets take a look at the compute graph which we have seen ealier. 
```c
    struct ggml_cgraph {
        int size;
        int n_nodes;
        int n_leafs;

        struct ggml_tensor ** nodes;
        struct ggml_tensor ** grads;
        struct ggml_tensor ** leafs;

        struct ggml_hash_set visited_hash_set;

        enum ggml_cgraph_eval_order order;
    };
```
So just like the compute graph has nodes, and leafs it also has grads which are
the gradients.

Now, lets take a look at the `ggml_compute_backward` function:
```c
  struct ggml_cgraph* b_graph = ggml_graph_dup(ctx, f_graph);
  ggml_build_backward_expand(ctx, f_graph, b_graph, /* keep gradients */ false);
```

```c
void ggml_build_backward_expand(struct ggml_context * ctx,
    struct ggml_cgraph * gf, struct ggml_cgraph * gb, bool keep) {

    if (keep) {
        for (int i = 0; i < gf->n_nodes; i++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * node = gf->nodes[i];

            if (node->grad) {
                node->grad = ggml_dup_tensor(ctx, node);
                gf->grads[i] = node->grad;
            }
        }
    }
```
So the last parameter is false in our case which means that we don't want to keep the
gradients from the forward compute graph, so this is duplicating those tensors so they
won't be modified.

### Tests
Tests for GGML are located in the tests directory. These are CTest tests which
is CMakes built-in test system. 

The available tests can be listed by running the following command:
```console
$ cd build
$ ctest -N
```
Running a test can be done by running the following command:
```console
$ ctest -R test1 -V
```

### Project structure
This is just a section about some of the files and directory that were not
obvious to me at first.

#### spm-headers
Thisis a Swift Package Manager directory which is referenced from the file
Package.swift:
```
...
    publicHeadersPath: "spm-headers",
```
So this is related to packaging the libary for Swift.

#### ggml.pc.in
This is a file used by the pkg-config tool.

#### .editorconfig
This is a file used to define and maintain consistent coding styles between
different editors and IDEs for a project.

#### build.zig
Is part of the [Zig build system)(https://ziglang.org/learn/build-system/).


### `ggml_context`
When we call `ggml_init` the first time there will a a few things that will
be done only for the first call. One of these is setting up a global
`g_state` struct.
```c
struct ggml_state {
    struct ggml_context_container contexts[GGML_MAX_CONTEXTS];
    struct ggml_numa_nodes numa;
};

struct ggml_context_container {
    bool used;
    struct ggml_context context;
};
```
This struct is created by the following code:
```c
            g_state = (struct ggml_state) {
                /*.contexts =*/ { { 0 } },
                /*.numa =*/ {
                    .n_nodes = 0,
                    .total_cpus = 0,
                },
            };
```
Now, `contexts` is being initialized using `{ { 0 } }`. The outer braces are
creating an array and the inner braces are creating one `ggml_context_container`
which is initalizes to 0 (`{ 0 }`). In C when we provide fewer initializers than
the number of elements in an array, the remaining elements are initialized to 0.
So by providing just `{ { 0 } }`, we explicitly zeroing out the first element,
and implicitly zeroing out all the rest.
Now, there is also an additional for loop that is initializing the `used` member
of each `ggml_context_container` to false:
```c
            for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_CONTEXTS; ++i) {
                g_state.contexts[i].used = false;
            }
```
But this should/has already been done by the `{ { 0 } }` initialization. If we
take a look at the history of this file this was previously:
```console
             g_state = (struct ggml_state) {
-                /*.contexts =*/ { 0 },
+                /*.contexts =*/ { { 0 } },
             };
```
So the above will only be done once and after this a free context from the
global state will be looked up:
```c
    // find non-used context in g_state
    struct ggml_context * ctx = NULL;

    for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_CONTEXTS; i++) {
        if (!g_state.contexts[i].used) {
            g_state.contexts[i].used = true;
            ctx = &g_state.contexts[i].context;

            GGML_PRINT_DEBUG("%s: found unused context %d\n", __func__, i);
            break;
        }
    }
```
After that there is a check to see if `params.mem_size` was set and if not
then set it to `GGML_MEM_ALIGN`:
```
    // allow to call ggml_init with 0 size
    if (params.mem_size == 0) {
        params.mem_size = GGML_MEM_ALIGN;
    }
```

```c
    const size_t mem_size = params.mem_buffer ? params.mem_size : GGML_PAD(params.mem_size, GGML_MEM_ALIGN);
    *ctx = (struct ggml_context) {
        /*.mem_size           =*/ mem_size,
        /*.mem_buffer         =*/ params.mem_buffer ? params.mem_buffer : GGML_ALIGNED_MALLOC(mem_size),
        /*.mem_buffer_owned   =*/ params.mem_buffer ? false : true,
        /*.no_alloc           =*/ params.no_alloc,
        /*.no_alloc_save      =*/ params.no_alloc,
        /*.n_objects          =*/ 0,
        /*.objects_begin      =*/ NULL,
        /*.objects_end        =*/ NULL,
        /*.scratch            =*/ { 0, 0, NULL, },
        /*.scratch_save       =*/ { 0, 0, NULL, },
    };
```
Now, in this case we did not set the `mem_buffer` parameter. So the
`GGML_ALIGNED_MALLOC` macro will be used and mem_size will be passed to it
which is 16 in this case:
```c
#define GGML_ALIGNED_MALLOC(size) ggml_aligned_malloc(size)

inline static void * ggml_aligned_malloc(size_t size) {
    if (size == 0) {
        GGML_PRINT("WARNING: Behavior may be unexpected when allocating 0 bytes for ggml_aligned_malloc!\n");
        return NULL;
    }
    void * aligned_memory = NULL;
    int result = posix_memalign(&aligned_memory, GGML_MEM_ALIGN, size);
    if (result != 0) {
        // Handle allocation failure
        const char *error_desc = "unknown allocation error";
        switch (result) {
            case EINVAL:
                error_desc = "invalid alignment value";
                break;
            case ENOMEM:
                error_desc = "insufficient memory";
                break;
        }
        GGML_PRINT("%s: %s (attempted to allocate %6.2f MB)\n", __func__, error_desc, size/(1024.0*1024.0));
        GGML_ABORT("fatal error");
        return NULL;
    }
    return aligned_memory;
}
```
In the above case I've removed the `GGML_USE_CPU_HBM` and `GGML_USE_METAL`
macros and just showing the one that is actually used for this debugging
session. So this will allocate 16 bytes of memory that is aligned to 16 bytes
and store the address in `aligned_memory`.
So the contexts `mem_buffer` will be set to this address for usage by this
context. This field is a void pointer so it can point to anything.

After the context has been initalized it looks like:
```console
(gdb) p *ctx
$4 = {mem_size = 16, mem_buffer = 0x5555556b0740, mem_buffer_owned = true,
no_alloc = false, no_alloc_save = false, n_objects = 0, objects_begin = 0x0,
objects_end = 0x0, scratch = {offs = 0, size = 0, data = 0x0},
scratch_save = {offs = 0, size = 0, data = 0x0}}
```
And this will be returned to the caller of `ggml_init`.


### `ggml_is_empty`
Just a note about the `ggml_is_empty` function:
```c
GGML_CALL bool ggml_is_empty(const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_DIMS; ++i) {
        if (tensor->ne[i] == 0) {
            // empty if any dimension has no elements
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}
```
If a tensor has any dimension that is 0 then it is considered empty. This makes
sense as if we have a 2d tensor of size 4x0 (4 x-axis element and 0 y-axis) ther
are no elements in the tensor.

### `no_alloc`
When we create a `ggml_context` we can pass in a number of configuration
parameters using `struct ggml_init_params`:
```c
    struct ggml_init_params {
        // memory pool
        size_t mem_size;   // bytes
        void * mem_buffer; // if NULL, memory will be allocated internally
        bool   no_alloc;   // don't allocate memory for the tensor data
    };
```

```c 
  struct ggml_init_params params = {
    .mem_size   = 16*1024*1024, // 16 MB
    .mem_buffer = NULL,
    .no_alloc   = false,
  };
  struct ggml_context* ctx = ggml_init(params);
```
So what does `no_alloc` actually do?  

Lets take a look using the example [no-alloc.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/no-alloc.c).
```console
$ gdb --args ./bin/no-alloc 
Reading symbols from ./bin/no-alloc...
(gdb) br no-alloc.c:16
Breakpoint 1 at 0x4b65: file src/no-alloc.c, line 16.
(gdb) r
(gdb) p *no_alloc_ctx
$2 = {mem_size = 16777216,
      mem_buffer = 0x7ffff6a00010,
      mem_buffer_owned = true,
      no_alloc = false,
      no_alloc_save = false,
      n_objects = 0,
      objects_begin = 0x0,
      objects_end = 0x0,
      scratch = {offs = 0, size = 0, data = 0x0},
      scratch_save = {offs = 0, size = 0, data = 0x0}}
```
Now, lets see what happens when we create a tensor using this context.
```c
static struct ggml_tensor * ggml_new_tensor_impl(
        struct ggml_context * ctx,
        enum   ggml_type      type,
        int                   n_dims,
        const int64_t       * ne,
        struct ggml_tensor  * view_src,
        size_t                view_offs) {
        ...

    size_t obj_alloc_size = 0;
    if (view_src == NULL && !ctx->no_alloc) {
        if (ctx->scratch.data != NULL) {
```
`view_src` will be NULL in our case as we have set `.no_alloc = false` above
so this if statement will have its block executed.

```c
    if (view_src == NULL && !ctx->no_alloc) {
        if (ctx->scratch.data != NULL) {
           ...
        } else {
            // allocate tensor data in the context's memory pool
            obj_alloc_size = data_size;
        }
    }
```
So in this case `obj_alloc_size` will be set to 4 which will be used in the
creation of a new ggml object:
```c
struct ggml_object * const obj_new = ggml_new_object(ctx,
    GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_TENSOR, GGML_TENSOR_SIZE + obj_alloc_size);
```
So this will use the memory of the context `mem_buffer`. So when `no_alloc` is
false this what will happen.

Lets try an example where we set `no_alloc` to true. The context will still get
its `mem_buffer` allocated just as in the previous example. But the context will
have `no_alloc` and `no_alloc_save` set to true: So when we create a tensor
```console
(gdb) p *ctx
$3 = {mem_size = 1024, mem_buffer = 0x5555556b0740, mem_buffer_owned = true,
no_alloc = true, no_alloc_save = true, n_objects = 0, objects_begin = 0x0,
objects_end = 0x0, scratch = {offs = 0, size = 0, data = 0x0}, scratch_save = {offs = 0, size = 0, data = 0x0}}
```
So lets see if there is any difference when creating a tensor. There is a
difference in this case as we won't enter the following if statement and
hence `obj_alloc_size` will be 0:
```c
    size_t data_size = ggml_row_size(type, ne[0]);

    size_t obj_alloc_size = 0;

    if (view_src == NULL && !ctx->no_alloc) {
       ...
    }
    struct ggml_object * const obj_new = ggml_new_object(ctx, GGML_OBJECT_TYPE_TENSOR, GGML_TENSOR_SIZE + obj_alloc_size);
```
In this case `obj_alloc_size` will be 0 and not the size of `data_size` which
was 4 in the previous example.  So the size of this object created will not
include the data for it after the tensor struct. This makes sense as we might
not won't to allocated the data for the tensor in the main memory and instead
use a different backend.

Now, we can also pass in a `mem_buffer` to the context which will be used and
no memory will be allocated internally:
```c
  char stack_buffer[1024];
  struct ggml_init_params sb_params = {
    .mem_size   = 1024,
    .mem_buffer = stack_buffer,
    .no_alloc   = true,
  };
  struct ggml_context* sb_ctx = ggml_init(sb_params);
```
And we can inspect the memory used:
```console
(gdb) p sb_ctx->mem_buffer
$7 = (void *) 0x7fffffffd5e0
(gdb) p &stack_buffer
$8 = (char (*)[1024]) 0x7fffffffd5e0
```

### ggml_conv_1d
This is a convolution operation of a over 1d tensor (the input). So the input
can be a vector/list of numbers like audio samples for example.
```console
input = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
```
And we have a kernel of some size which we slide over the input tensor:
```console

input  = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
kernal = [1, 2] 

Stride: 1
         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
         [1, 2] 
         (0*1+1*2) = 2                    [2] 

         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
            [1, 2] 
            (1*1+2*2) = 5                 [2, 5]

         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
               [1, 2] 
               (2*1+3*2) = 8              [2, 5, 8]

         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
                  [1, 2] 
                  (3*1+4*2) = 11          [2, 5, 8, 11]

         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
                     [1, 2] 
                     (4*1+5*2) = 14       [2, 5, 8, 11, 14]

         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
                        [1, 2] 
                        (5*1+6*2) = 17    [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17]

         [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
                           [1, 2] 
                           (6*1+7*2) = 20 [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20]


output: [2, 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20]
```

Dilation is the spacing between the kernel elements. So if we have a kernel
of size 2 and a dilation of 1 then the kernel:
```
kernel         = [1, 2]
dilation       = 1
diluted kernel = [1, _, 2]
input = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
        [0, _, 2]
        (0*0+2*2) = 4                      [4]
        
        [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
           [0, _, 2]
           (1*1+3*2) = 7                   [4, 7]
```

So lets take a look at another example where the kernel matrix has more than
one dimension:
```
input shape:   {8, 1, 1}
kernel shape:  {4, 1, 6}
output shape:  {5, 6, 1}
```
So the input is the same as before but the kernel matrix and the output shape
might not be obvious at first.
```
input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]

kernel shape:  {4, 1, 6} :
                |  |  |
+---------------|--|--+
| +-------------|--+
↓ |      +------+
0 ↓      ↓
  0 [1  2  3   4]
1
  0 [5  6  7   8]
2 
  0 [9  10 11 12]
3
  0 [13 14 15 16]
4
  0 [17 18 19 20]
5
  0 [21 22 23 24]
```
So this is saying that we have kernels of size 4, and we have 6 of them:
```
  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
0 [1 2 3 4]               = out0_0
    [1 2 3 4]             = out0_1
      [1 2 3 4]           = out0_2
        [1 2 3 4]         = out0_3
          [1 2 3 4]       = out0_4    [out0_0 out0_1 out0_2 out0_3 out0_4]
  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
1 [5 6 7 8]               = out1_0
    [5 6 7 8]             = out1_1
      [5 6 7 8]           = out1_2
        [5 6 7 8]         = out1_3
          [5 6 7 8]       = out1_4    [out1_0 out1_1 out1_2 out1_3 out1_4]
  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
2 [9 10 11 12]            = out2_0
    [9 10 11 12]          = out2_1
      [9 10 11 12]        = out2_2
        [9 10 11 12]      = out2_3
          [9 10 11 12]    = out2_4    [out2_0 out2_1 out2_2 out2_3 out2_4]
  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
3 [13 14 15 16]           = out3_0
    [13 14 15 16]         = out3_1
      [13 14 15 16]       = out3_2
        [13 14 15 16]     = out3_3
          [13 14 15 16]   = out3_4    [out3_0 out3_1 out3_2 out3_3 out3_4]
  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
4 [17 18 19 20]           = out4_0
    [17 18 19 20]         = out4_1
      [17 18 19 20]       = out4_2
        [17 18 19 20]     = out4_3
          [17 18 19 20]   = out4_4    [out4_0 out4_1 out4_2 out4_3 out4_4]
  [1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8]
5 [21 22 23 24]           = out5_0
    [21 22 23 24]         = out5_1
      [21 22 23 24]       = out5_2
        [21 22 23 24]     = out5_3
          [21 22 23 24]   = out5_4    [out5_0 out5_1 out5_2 out5_3 out5_4]

 <-------    5 (x-axis     --------->
 [out0_0 out0_1 out0_2 out0_3 out0_4]  ^
 [out1_0 out1_1 out1_2 out1_3 out1_4]  |
 [out2_0 out2_1 out2_2 out2_3 out2_4]  6 (y-axis)
 [out3_0 out3_1 out3_2 out3_3 out3_4]
 [out4_0 out4_1 out4_2 out4_3 out4_4]  |
 [out5_0 out5_1 out5_2 out5_3 out5_4]  v
```
So this hopefully clarifies what the kernel matrix represents, which in this
case is a kernel of size 4 and we have 6 of them which will all convolve over
the input and produc and output or size five each. And because we have 6
kernels we will have 6 outputs, and each output will have 5 elements giving
and output size of {5, 6}.


### `ggml_conv_2d`
This is a convolution of a 2d tensor in GGML. So we have a kernel which slides
over the input tensor and an element wise multiplication of the kernel and the
input tensor is calculated at each position of the kernel and then summing.
```console
Input Tensor (8x2):                Kernel (2x2):
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |    | 1 | 2 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+
| 9 |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |    | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+

Convolution Operation (stride 1, no padding):

Step 1:     Step 2:     Step 3:     Step 4:
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
| 1 | 2 |   | 2 | 3 |   | 3 | 4 |   | 4 | 5 |
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
| 9 |10 |   |10 |11 |   |11 |12 |   |12 |13 |
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
    |           |           |           |
    v           v           v           v
   72          82          92         102

Step 5:     Step 6:     Step 7:
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
| 5 | 6 |   | 6 | 7 |   | 7 | 8 |
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
|13 |14 |   |14 |15 |   |15 |16 |
+---+---+   +---+---+   +---+---+
    |           |           |
    v           v           v
   112         122         132

Result (7x1):
+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+
| 72 | 82 | 92 | 102 | 112 | 122 | 132 |
+----+----+----+-----+-----+-----+-----+

One calculation:
[1  2]   [1  2]  =  [1*1 + 2*2 + 9*1 + 10*2] = 72 
[9 10]   [3  4]   
```

One of the parameters that can be passed to the `ggml_conv_2d` function is the
`dilation` parameter.  Dilation ("atrous convoluation" from the French term
"à trous," meaning "with holes").This is the spacing between the kernel elements.
So if we 
* 0 means no kernel elementes will be applied.
* 1 means no dilation.
* 2 means one space between kernel elements.

An example can be found in [conv2d.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/conv2d.c).

Our input tensor and kernel will look like this:
```console

  b  (8x2):                           a (2x2):
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |    | 1 | 2 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+
| 9 |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |    | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+
```
And we will have stride of 1 and no padding, and no dilation.

```console
$ gdb --args bin/conv2d
```
We can step into `ggml_conv_2d` and see what is happening:
```c
// a: [OC，IC, KH, KW]   
// b: [N, IC, IH, IW]
// result: [N, OC, OH, OW]
//
// OC: output channels
// IC: input channels
// KH: kernel height
// KW: kernel width
// N: batch size
// IC: input channels
// IH: input height
// IW: input width
struct ggml_tensor * ggml_conv_2d(
        struct ggml_context * ctx,
        struct ggml_tensor  * a,  // kernel
        struct ggml_tensor  * b,  // input tensor
        int                   s0, // stride x
        int                   s1, // stride y
        int                   p0, // padding x
        int                   p1, // padding y
        int                   d0, // dilation x
        int                   d1) // dilation y{
    struct ggml_tensor * im2col = ggml_im2col(ctx, a, b, s0, s1, p0, p1, d0, d1, true, a->type); // [N, OH, OW, IC * KH * KW]
```
Notice that this uses `ggml_im2col` which there is a section on in this
document. This will prepare the input tensor so that matrix multiplication can
be used to perform the convolution operation.
The resulting `im2col` tensor looks like this:
```console
(gdb) p *im2col 
$2 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0,
ne = {4, 7, 1, 1}, nb = { 4, 16, 112, 112}, op = GGML_OP_IM2COL, op_params = {1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 
0}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x7ffff6a00030, 0x7ffff6a001b0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 
0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a004b0, name = '\000' <repeats 63 times>, extra = 0x0}

Patch 1      Patch 2   Patch 3    Patch 4     Patch 5     Patch 6   Patch 7
+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| 1  2     | 2  3     | 3  4     | 4  5     | 5  6     | 6  7     | 7  8     |
| 9  10    | 10 11    | 11 12    | 12 13    | 13 14    | 14 15    | 15 16    |
+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
```
Next in `ggml_im2col` we have:
```c
    struct ggml_tensor * result =
        ggml_mul_mat(ctx,
                ggml_reshape_2d(ctx, im2col, im2col->ne[0],  im2col->ne[3] * im2col->ne[2] * im2col->ne[1]),
                ggml_reshape_2d(ctx, a, (a->ne[0] * a->ne[1] * a->ne[2]),  a->ne[3]));

    result = ggml_reshape_4d(ctx, result, im2col->ne[1], im2col->ne[2], im2col->ne[3], a->ne[3]);
    result = ggml_cont(ctx, ggml_permute(ctx, result, 0, 1, 3, 2));

    return result;
```
Notice that the above is reshaping the result from `im2col` which in our case
does not change the shape of the tensor:
```console
(gdb) p *ggml_reshape_2d(ctx, im2col, im2col->ne[0],  im2col->ne[3] * im2col->ne[2] * im2col->ne[1])

$4 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0,
ne = {4, 7, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 16, 112, 112}, op = GGML_OP_RESHAPE,
op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x7ffff6a00360, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x7ffff6a00360, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a004b0,
name = " (reshaped)", '\000' <repeats 52 times>, extra = 0x0}
```
Also the kernel is reshaped:
```console
(gdb) p *ggml_reshape_2d(ctx, a, (a->ne[0] * a->ne[1] * a->ne[2]),  a->ne[3])
$7 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0, ne = {4, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 16, 16, 16}, 
op = GGML_OP_RESHAPE, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x7ffff6a00030, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 
0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x7ffff6a00030, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a00180, 
name = "a (reshaped)", '\000' <repeats 51 times>, extra = 0x0}

Making the kernal into a row vector:
[1  2  3  4]
```
And then those reshaped tensors are multiplied using matrix multiplication:
```console
reshaped(a)       reshaped(im2col)
[1  2  3  4] × [1   2   3   4   5   6   7 ]
               [2   3   4   5   6   7   8 ]
               [9  10  11  12  13  14  15 ]
               [10 11  12  13  14  15  16 ]
```
The result from the matrix multiplication will be:
```console
(gdb) p *result
$9 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0,
ne = {7, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 28, 28, 28}, 
op = GGML_OP_MUL_MAT, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x7ffff6a00c70, 0x7ffff6a00b00, 
0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a00f30, 
name = '\000' <repeats 63 times>, extra = 0x0}
```
Next the result from the matrix multiplication is reshaped:
```c
    result = ggml_reshape_4d(ctx, result, im2col->ne[1], im2col->ne[2], im2col->ne[3], a->ne[3]);
```
```console
(gdb) p *result
$10 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x0, ne = {7, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 28, 28, 28},
  op = GGML_OP_RESHAPE, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x7ffff6a00de0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x7ffff6a00de0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x7ffff6a00f30,
  name = " (reshaped)", '\000' <repeats 52 times>, extra = 0x0
```
And finally we have a permutation of the tensor and an operation to make it
contiguous:
```c
    result = ggml_cont(ctx, ggml_permute(ctx, result, 0, 1, 3, 2));
```
Now the matrix multipliation operation likely creates a tensor that is
contiguous in memory. The reshaping operations change the interpretation of the
tensors dimensinons without change the actual data in the tensor. The permuation
operation logically reorders the tensor without changing the data. `ggml_cont`
is used to ensure that the physical memory layout matches the logical layout
after these operations.

For image tensors we would probably have a channel dimension and also a batch.
I'm thinking this might look something like this in ggml:
```
 [ x-dim, y-dim, channel-dim, batch-dim]
```

### image to column (im2col)
This is a common technique used in convolutional neural networks (CNN). The idea
is to transform image data, or more generally a multi-dimensional tensor, into a
format that allows for efficient computation of the convolution operation using
matrix multiplication. So we might have as input a 3d image and we want to turn
this into a 2d array that we can treat like a matrix.

This works by taking patches of the input tensor and reshaping them into columns.
```
Input tensor (5x5):          Kernel (3x3):
+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |      | 1 | 2 | 3 |
+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+
| 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10|      | 4 | 5 | 6 |
+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+
| 11| 12| 13| 14| 15|      | 7 | 8 | 9 |
+---+---+---+---+---+      +---+---+---+
| 16| 17| 18| 19| 20|
+---+---+---+---+---+
| 21| 22| 23| 24| 25|
+---+---+---+---+---+

stride = 1, padding = 0, dilation = 1 (none)
```
The im2col process will extract 3x3 patches and arrange them as columns:
```
Patch 1       Patch 2   Patch 3   Patch 4    ...
+----------+----------+----------+----------+---
| 1  2  3  | 2  3  4  | 3  4  5  | 6  7  8  |
| 6  7  8  | 7  8  9  | 8  9 10  | 11 12 13 |
| 11 12 13 | 12 13 14 | 13 14 15 | 16 17 18 |
+----------+----------+----------+----------+---
```
Notice that there is overlap between the patches.

So this is an operation that prepares a tensor that can then be used in a matrix
operation, for example a convolution operation. We could apply this to the
above conv2d example:
```
Input Tensor (8x2):                Kernel (2x2):
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |    | 1 | 2 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+
| 9 |10 |11 |12 |13 |14 |15 |16 |    | 3 | 4 |
+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+    +---+---+


Patch 1      Patch 2   Patch 3    Patch 4     Patch 5     Patch 6   Patch 7
+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
| 1  2     | 2  3     | 3  4     | 4  5     | 5  6     | 6  7     | 7  8     |
| 9  10    | 10 11    | 11 12    | 12 13    | 13 14    | 14 15    | 15 16    |
+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+

Make the kernal into a row vector:
[1  2  3  4]

Now, we can perform a matrix multiplication:

[1  2  3  4] × [1   2   3   4   5   6   7 ] = [72  82  92  102  112  122  132]
               [2   3   4   5   6   7   8 ]
               [9  10  11  12  13  14  15 ]
               [10 11  12  13  14  15  16 ]
```
Matrix mutliplication is a very efficient operation and can be offloaded onto
a GPU for example. So this is a way to speed up the convolution operation.

There is also a standalone example of using `ggml_im2col` in
[im2col.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/im2col.c).


### `ggml_norm`
This is a normalization operation in GGML. This is used to normalize the input
tensor. 
```
z = (x - μ) / sqrt(σ² + ε)

Where:
z is the normalized tensor.
x is the input tensor.
μ is the mean of the input tensor.
σ² is the variance of the input tensor.
ε is a small value to avoid division by zero
```

The function declaration looks like this:
```c
    // normalize along rows
    GGML_API struct ggml_tensor * ggml_norm(
            struct ggml_context * ctx,
            struct ggml_tensor  * a,
            float                 eps);
```
Where a is the input tensor we want to normalize and eps is a small value to
avoid division by zero. The above is only creating the tensor operation for this
and the actual compuation looks like this:
```c
static void ggml_compute_forward_norm_f32(
        const struct ggml_compute_params * params,
        struct ggml_tensor * dst) {

    const struct ggml_tensor * src0 = dst->src[0];

    const int ith = params->ith;
    const int nth = params->nth;

    GGML_TENSOR_UNARY_OP_LOCALS

    float eps;
    memcpy(&eps, dst->op_params, sizeof(float));

    for (int64_t i03 = 0; i03 < ne03; i03++) {
        for (int64_t i02 = 0; i02 < ne02; i02++) {
            for (int64_t i01 = ith; i01 < ne01; i01 += nth) {
                const float * x = (float *) ((char *) src0->data + i01*nb01 + i02*nb02 + i03*nb03);

                ggml_float sum = 0.0;
                for (int64_t i00 = 0; i00 < ne00; i00++) {
                    sum += (ggml_float)x[i00];
                }

                float mean = sum/ne00;

                float * y = (float *) ((char *) dst->data + i01*nb1 + i02*nb2 + i03*nb3);

                ggml_float sum2 = 0.0;
                for (int64_t i00 = 0; i00 < ne00; i00++) {
                    float v = x[i00] - mean;
                    y[i00] = v;
                    sum2 += (ggml_float)(v*v);
                }

                float variance = sum2/ne00;
                const float scale = 1.0f/sqrtf(variance + eps);

                ggml_vec_scale_f32(ne00, y, scale);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
The for loop is iterating over all the elements in the batch, and then sequence
and then the rows. I'm only using one thread to make it easier to step through
but normally there would be multiple threads performing this operation on
different rows in parallel.
First a float pointer is created that points into the source tensor data for
the row that is being processed.
For each element in this row the following will sum the entries and then
calculate the mean:
```c
                ggml_float sum = 0.0;
                for (int64_t i00 = 0; i00 < ne00; i00++) {
                    sum += (ggml_float)x[i00];
                }
                float mean = sum/ne00;
```
```console
(gdb) p sum
$17 = 15
(gdb) p sum/ne00
$18 = 3
```
Next a float pointer in to the destination tensors data is created and this
will be used to subtract the mean and calculate the variance:
```c
                float * y = (float *) ((char *) dst->data + i01*nb1 + i02*nb2 + i03*nb3);
                ggml_float sum2 = 0.0;
                for (int64_t i00 = 0; i00 < ne00; i00++) {
                    float v = x[i00] - mean;
                    y[i00] = v;
                    sum2 += (ggml_float)(v*v);
                }
```
And notice that sum2 is the sum of the squared differences from the mean.
And then we normalize, we scale the input by this value using:
```c
                float variance = sum2/ne00;
                const float scale = 1.0f/sqrtf(variance + eps);
                ggml_vec_scale_f32(ne00, y, scale);
```
Just clarify this, this is performed per row and there might be multiple thread
performing this operation in parallel.

Now, lets take a closer looks at the `ggml_vec_scale_f32` function:
```c
inline static void ggml_vec_scale_f32(const int n, float * y, const float   v) {
#if defined(GGML_USE_ACCELERATE)
    vDSP_vsmul(y, 1, &v, y, 1, n);
#elif defined(GGML_SIMD)
    const int np = (n & ~(GGML_F32_STEP - 1));

    GGML_F32_VEC vx = GGML_F32_VEC_SET1(v);

    GGML_F32_VEC ay[GGML_F32_ARR];

    for (int i = 0; i < np; i += GGML_F32_STEP) {
        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_F32_ARR; j++) {
            ay[j] = GGML_F32_VEC_LOAD(y + i + j*GGML_F32_EPR);
            ay[j] = GGML_F32_VEC_MUL(ay[j], vx);

            GGML_F32_VEC_STORE(y + i + j*GGML_F32_EPR, ay[j]);
        }
    }

    // leftovers
    for (int i = np; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] *= v;
    }
#else
    // scalar
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] *= v;
    }
#endif
}
```
Now, I'm currently running this on Linux and the `GGML_SIMD` macro is defined.
I'm copying the values that are used here from the [simd](./simd) section of
below which also contains some more details.
```c
#define GGML_F32_STEP 32
#define GGML_F32_EPR  8

#define GGML_F32_VEC        GGML_F32x8
#define GGML_F32x8         __m256

#define GGML_F32_VEC_SET1   GGML_F32x8_SET1
#define GGML_F32x8_SET1(x) _mm256_set1_ps(x)

#define GGML_F32_VEC_LOAD   GGML_F32x8_LOAD
#define GGML_F32x8_LOAD    _mm256_loadu_ps

#define GGML_F32_VEC_MUL    GGML_F32x8_MUL
#define GGML_F32x8_MUL     _mm256_mul_ps

#define GGML_F32_VEC_STORE  GGML_F32x8_STORE
#define GGML_F32x8_STORE   _mm256_storeu_ps

#define GGML_F32_ARR (GGML_F32_STEP/GGML_F32_EPR)
```
And this is the function with the macros expanded:
```c
inline static void ggml_vec_scale_f32(const int n, float * y, const float   v) {
    const int np = (n & ~(32 - 1));

    // This will set all the values in the vector to v (the scale value)
    __m256 vx = _mm256_set1_ps(v);

    // This declares an array of 4 _m256 vectors (each can store 8 32 bit floats)
    // So ay can hold a total of 32 float values.
    __m256 ay[4];

    // Processes the vector in chunks of 32
    for (int i = 0; i < np; i += 32) {
        for (int j = 0; j < 4; j++) {
            // load 32 bytes from the memory address calculated by y+i+j*4 in to a register
            ay[j] = _mm256_loadu_ps(y + i + j * 4);
            // multiply the values of the current chunk by the scale value
            ay[j] = _mm256_mul_ps(ay[j], vx);

            // Write the data back to memory from the register.
            _mm256_storeu_ps(y + i + j*4, ay[j]);
        }
    }

    // leftovers
    for (int i = np; i < n; ++i) {
        y[i] *= v;
    }
}
```


### simd
There is SIMD support in ggml which is enable by using pre-processor macros
and these are based on the features of the target CPU that is being compiled
for.

When I'm on Linux I can see the that the following macros will be defined
and used:
```c

```
`GGML_F16_STEP 32` defines how may many elements can be processed in a single
SIMD instruction for F16 (half precision) floating point numbers.
`GGML_F16_EPR  8` defines the number of elements per register for F16.
`GGML_F16_ARR (GGML_F16_STEP/GGML_F16_EPR)` defines the number of registers to
use per step for F16 (half precision) floating point numbers.

So we can process 32 elements in a single SIMD instruction and 8 elements can
fit into a single register. So the number of registers we need to user for one
step is 32/8 = 4. 
So we can process 32 F16 numbers and we need 4 registers to do so each storing
8 floating point numbers.




### graph allocator (galloc)
This section is about the graph allocator in GGML. And example of using this
can be found here [galloc.c](../fundamentals/ggml/src/galloc.c) and we'll be
using this example to step through the code.

```console
$ gdb --args bin/galloc
```

The code in the example creates a graph in the same way that we "usually" do and
is done in the same way as the other examples.
```c
  struct ggml_cgraph* c_graph = ggml_new_graph(ctx);
  ggml_build_forward_expand(c_graph, result);
```
With the graph we can create a new graph allocator using `ggml_gallocr_new`:
```c
  ggml_gallocr_t galloc = ggml_gallocr_new(ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type());
```
`ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type` returns a pointer to a buffer type as this type
is defined as:
```c
typedef struct ggml_backend_buffer_type * ggml_backend_buffer_type_t;
```

So lets take a look at this struct that is going to be returned to get an
overview:
```c
struct ggml_gallocr {
    ggml_backend_buffer_type_t * bufts;          // [n_buffers]
    ggml_backend_buffer_t * buffers;             // [n_buffers]
    struct ggml_dyn_tallocr ** buf_tallocs;      // [n_buffers]
    int n_buffers;

    struct ggml_hash_set hash_set;
    struct hash_node * hash_values;              // [hash_set.size]

    struct node_alloc * node_allocs;             // [n_nodes]
    int n_nodes;

    struct leaf_alloc * leaf_allocs;             // [n_leafs]
    int n_leafs;
};
```
So we have an array of buffer types, and one for the actual buffers, one for the
tensor allocators. These all have the same number of elemements and the indices
match up. What I mean is that if we have index 2 then the buffer type is at
index 2 as will the buffer for it and the tensor allocator.

And notice that we are passing in the `ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type` which again
is a pointer to a struct `ggml_backend_buffer_type`:
```c
ggml_gallocr_t ggml_gallocr_new(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft) {
    return ggml_gallocr_new_n(&buft, 1);
}
```
Notice that `ggml_gallocr_new_n` has a `n` in it so it can take an array of
backend buffer types and not just a pointer to a single one which is the case
here. Recall that passing an array is really just passing a pointer to the first
element of the array.

The first things that happens is that the galloc struct is calloced (allocated
and cleared):
```c
ggml_gallocr_t ggml_gallocr_new_n(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t * bufts, int n_bufs) {
    ggml_gallocr_t galloc = (ggml_gallocr_t)calloc(1, sizeof(struct ggml_gallocr));
    GGML_ASSERT(galloc != NULL);
```
And then the following arrays are calloced which have the size of the buffer
types array, the buffers array, and the tensor allocators arrays:
```c
    galloc->bufts = calloc(n_bufs, sizeof(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t));
    GGML_ASSERT(galloc->bufts != NULL);

    galloc->buffers = calloc(n_bufs, sizeof(ggml_backend_buffer_t));
    GGML_ASSERT(galloc->buffers != NULL);

    galloc->buf_tallocs = calloc(n_bufs, sizeof(struct ggml_dyn_tallocr *));
    GGML_ASSERT(galloc->buf_tallocs != NULL);
```

Then we have the following iteration over the number of buffers, which is this
case is 1 which was passed in as an argument above:
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < n_bufs; i++) {
        galloc->bufts[i] = bufts[i];
        galloc->buffers[i] = NULL;

        // check if the same buffer type is used multiple times and reuse the same allocator
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (bufts[i] == bufts[j]) {
                galloc->buf_tallocs[i] = galloc->buf_tallocs[j];
                break;
            }
        }

        if (galloc->buf_tallocs[i] == NULL) {
            size_t alignment = ggml_backend_buft_get_alignment(bufts[i]);
            galloc->buf_tallocs[i] = ggml_dyn_tallocr_new(alignment);
        }
    }
    galloc->n_buffers = n_bufs;

    return galloc;
}
```
We can see above that `galloc->bufts[i]` is set to the buffer type that was
passed in (in this case we only passed in 1 buffer type) but this function can
also be called with an array.  And we can see that the `galloc.buffers[i]` is
set to NULL. There is also a _dynamic_ tensor allocator which is different from
the tensor allocator that we've seen before.
```c
static struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * ggml_dyn_tallocr_new(size_t alignment) {
    struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc = (struct ggml_dyn_tallocr *)malloc(sizeof(struct ggml_dyn_tallocr));

    *alloc = (struct ggml_dyn_tallocr) {
        /*.alignment     = */ alignment,
        /*.n_free_blocks = */ 0,
        /*.free_blocks   = */ {{0}},
        /*.max_size      = */ 0,
#ifdef GGML_ALLOCATOR_DEBUG
        /*.allocated_tensors = */ {{0}},
#endif
    };

    ggml_dyn_tallocr_reset(alloc);

    return alloc;
}
```
I'll revisit this struct later when it is used.

That will return us back in the example and we will call:
```c
  ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph(galloc, c_graph);
```

```c
bool ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_cgraph * graph) {
    if (ggml_gallocr_needs_realloc(galloc, graph)) {
        if (galloc->n_buffers == 1) {
            fprintf(stderr, "%s: reallocating buffers automatically\n", __func__);

            if (!ggml_gallocr_reserve(galloc, graph)) {
                return false;
            }
```
In this case `ggml_gallocr_reserve` will be called:
```c
bool ggml_gallocr_reserve(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_cgraph *graph) {
    return ggml_gallocr_reserve_n(galloc, graph, NULL, NULL);
}
```

```c
bool ggml_gallocr_reserve_n(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_cgraph * graph,
    const int * node_buffer_ids, const int * leaf_buffer_ids) {
    size_t min_hash_size = graph->n_nodes + graph->n_leafs;
    // add 25% margin to avoid hash collisions
    min_hash_size += min_hash_size / 4;

    // initialize hash table
    if (galloc->hash_set.size < min_hash_size) {
        ggml_hash_set_free(&galloc->hash_set);
        galloc->hash_set = ggml_hash_set_new(min_hash_size);
        GGML_ASSERT(galloc->hash_set.keys != NULL);

        free(galloc->hash_values);
        galloc->hash_values = malloc(sizeof(struct hash_node) * galloc->hash_set.size);
        GGML_ASSERT(galloc->hash_values != NULL);
    }
```
In this case `min_hash_size` will be 3 and `galloc->hash_set.size` is 0.

A new hash set will be created by calling `ggml_hash_set_new` and
`min_hash_size` is 3 in this case:
```c
struct ggml_hash_set ggml_hash_set_new(size_t size) {
    size = ggml_hash_size(size);
    struct ggml_hash_set result;
    result.size = size;
    result.keys = GGML_MALLOC(sizeof(struct ggml_tensor *) * size);
    result.used = GGML_CALLOC(ggml_bitset_size(size), sizeof(ggml_bitset_t));
    return result;
}
``` 
The function `ggml_bitset_size` function is used to calculate the number of
elements that are needed for the `used` array (array of `uinit32_t`) in the
`hash_set` struct.
For example:
```
n is the number of bits we want to be able to store.

If n = 10, 10 + 31 >> 5 = 41 >> 5 = 1
If n = 32, 32 + 31 >> 5 = 63 >> 5 = 1
If n = 33, 33 + 31 >> 5 = 64 >> 5 = 2
```

The returned value from this function will be of type `struct ggml_hash_set`:
```console
(gdb) ptype result
type = struct ggml_hash_set {
    size_t size;
    ggml_bitset_t *used;
    struct ggml_tensor **keys;
}
```
So the size will be 3 and the `keys` array will be allocated with 3 elements.

Next in `ggml_gallocr_reserve_n` we have the following:
```c
    free(galloc->hash_values);
    galloc->hash_values = malloc(sizeof(struct hash_node) * galloc->hash_set.size);
```
Notice here that this is allocating the same number of `hash_values` and
`hash_set` size value which is 3 in our case. The `hash_values` is an array of
`hash_node` structs:
```
struct hash_node {
    int n_children;
    int n_views;
    int buffer_id;
    size_t offset; // offset within the buffer
    bool allocated;
};
```
So a hash node stores the number of children a node has, the number of views
it has. A buffer id which might is an index into the buffer types array,
and an offset within the buffer where it is allocated (if it is allocated). And
a boolean that tells us if the node is allocated or not.

So the hash set enable us to quickly find a tensor, for example (this was taken
at a later stage when the hash set has been populated):
```console
(gdb) p *b
$456 = {type = GGML_TYPE_F32, backend = GGML_BACKEND_TYPE_CPU, buffer = 0x5555556b1bb0, ne = {2, 1, 1, 1}, nb = {4, 8, 8,
    8}, op = GGML_OP_NONE, op_params = {0 <repeats 16 times>}, flags = 0, grad = 0x0, src = {0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0,
    0x0, 0x0, 0x0, 0x0}, view_src = 0x0, view_offs = 0, data = 0x5555556b1b60, name = "b", '\000' <repeats 62 times>,
  extra = 0x0}

(gdb) p ggml_hash_find_or_insert(&galloc->hash_set, b)
$457 = 1

(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[ggml_hash_find_or_insert(&galloc->hash_set, b)]
$460 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, allocated = false}

(gdb) p *ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, b)
$455 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, allocated = false}
```

At this stage there will be 3 entries in the `hash_values` array and they will
all be initialized to 0:
```console
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[0]
$65 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = false}
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[1]
$66 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = false}
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[2]
$67 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = false}
```

Next the dynamic tensor allocators (just one in our case) are reset:
```c
    // reset allocators
    for (int i = 0; i < galloc->n_buffers; i++) {
        ggml_dyn_tallocr_reset(galloc->buf_tallocs[i]);
    }
```

After that we have:
```c
    // allocate in hash table
    ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph_impl(galloc, graph, node_buffer_ids, leaf_buffer_ids);
```
And in our case we are only passing in galloc and graph and both the buffer and
leaf ids are null.
```c
static void ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph_impl(ggml_gallocr_t galloc,
    struct ggml_cgraph * graph, const int * node_buffer_ids, const int * leaf_buffer_ids) {

    // clear hash tables
    ggml_hash_set_reset(&galloc->hash_set);
    memset(galloc->hash_values, 0, sizeof(struct hash_node) * galloc->hash_set.size);
```
The above is resetting the hash values, but in this case they are already 0 as
we malloced the above.

Just to orient ourselfs lets take a look at the graph:
```console
(lldb) p ggml_graph_print(graph)
=== GRAPH ===
n_nodes = 1
 -   0: [     2,     3,     1]              MUL
n_leafs = 2
 -   0: [     2,     3]     NONE                a
 -   1: [     2,     1]     NONE                b
========================================
```
Next all the leafs (only a an b) in the graph are iterated over, starting with
`a`:
```c
static void ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph_impl(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_cgraph * graph, const int * node_buffer_ids, const int * leaf_buffer_ids) {
    ...
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_leafs; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * leaf = graph->leafs[i];
        ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(galloc, leaf, get_node_buffer_id(leaf_buffer_ids, i));
    }
```
And we are calling `ggml_gallocr_allocate_node` with the tensor `a`, and we know
from before that `leaf_buffer_ids` is null so the buffer id will be 0.
```c
static int get_node_buffer_id(const int * node_buffer_ids, int i) {
    return node_buffer_ids ? node_buffer_ids[i] : 0;
}
```
So lets take a closer look at `ggml_gallocr_allocate_node`:
```c
static void ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * node,
int buffer_id) {
    struct hash_node * hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, node);
```
```c
static struct hash_node * ggml_gallocr_hash_get(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * t) {
    size_t i = ggml_hash_find_or_insert(&galloc->hash_set, t);
    return &galloc->hash_values[i];
}
```
Notice that the above will insert the tensor into the hash set if it is not
already in it, and it will then use the index of the hash set entry to return
the corresponding hash node from the hash values array.

```c
static size_t ggml_hash_find_or_insert(struct ggml_hash_set * hash_set, struct ggml_tensor * key) {
    size_t h = ggml_hash(key) % hash_set->size;

    // linear probing
    size_t i = h;
    do {
        if (!ggml_bitset_get(hash_set->used, i)) {
            ggml_bitset_set(hash_set->used, i);
            hash_set->keys[i] = key;
            return i;
        }
        if (hash_set->keys[i] == key) {
            return i;
        }
        i = (i + 1) % hash_set->size;
    } while (i != h);

    // visited all hash table entries -> not found
    GGML_ABORT("fatal error");
}
```
The first thing is that a hash for the tensor is calculated which is using the 
address of the pointer as a key (shifted to account for alignment), and then
this is "compressed" into the range of our hash set size.

The do/while loop is checking if the _index_ is already set, using
`ggml_bitset_get` (which I can think of as `ggml_bitset_isset`).  And if the
index is not set then it will be set and they tensor will be stored in the keys
array at the index and then the index is returned.

If the index has already been set then we check if the current index is the same
as the tensor that we are looking for and if it is then we return the index. The
index is then incremented and we also need to make sure that it is still in the
range of the hash set size wo we need to mod it again.  This will return the
index for the tensor, and then `ggml_gallocr_hash_get` will return the
corresponding hash node. 

The index for the tensor `a` will be 
```console
(gdb) p i
$81 = 2
```
```c
    size_t i = ggml_hash_find_or_insert(&galloc->hash_set, t);
    return &galloc->hash_values[i];
```
This will return the address of:
```console
(gdb) p *&galloc->hash_values[i]
$83 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = false}
```
So that `hash_node` will then be returned an stored in `hn`:
```c
static void ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * node, int buffer_id) {
    struct hash_node * hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, node);
```
Next in `ggml_gallocr_allocate_node` we have:
```c
    if (!ggml_gallocr_is_allocated(galloc, node) && !ggml_is_view(node)) {
        hn->allocated = true;
        assert(hn->offset == 0);
```
```c
static bool ggml_gallocr_is_allocated(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * t) {
    return t->data != NULL || ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, t)->allocated;
}
```
Notice that this is performing another call to `ggml_gallocr_hash_get` with
the name node/tensor (`a`) and then it is checking if the tensor is allocated
or not.  So the first thing that happens is `hash_node` allocated field is set
to true.
```console
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[2]
$88 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}
```

The tensor `a` is not an operations so the following if block will be skipped:
```c
static void ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * node, int buffer_id) {
    ...
        if (ggml_op_can_inplace(node->op)) {
            for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_SRC; i++) {
                struct ggml_tensor * parent = node->src[i];
                if (parent == NULL) {
                    continue;
                }
                ...
            }
            ....
        }
```
But the following block will be executed:
```c
        // allocate tensor from the buffer
        struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc = galloc->buf_tallocs[buffer_id];
        ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft = galloc->bufts[buffer_id];
        size_t size = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(buft, node);

        size_t offset = ggml_dyn_tallocr_alloc(alloc, size, node);
        hn->buffer_id = buffer_id;
        hn->offset = offset;
        return;
```
But the last part is of interest. So the dynamic tensor allocator is retrieved.
And we also get a pointer to the buffer type.

Now, lets look at `ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size`:
```c
GGML_CALL size_t ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft,
    struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    // get_alloc_size is optional, defaults to ggml_nbytes
    if (buft->iface.get_alloc_size) {
        size_t size = buft->iface.get_alloc_size(buft, tensor);
        assert(size >= ggml_nbytes(tensor));
        return size;
    }
    return ggml_nbytes(tensor);
}
```
In our case `ggml_n_bytes` will be called:
```c
GGML_CALL size_t ggml_nbytes(const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    size_t nbytes;
    size_t blck_size = ggml_blck_size(tensor->type);
    if (blck_size == 1) {
        nbytes = ggml_type_size(tensor->type);
        for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_DIMS; ++i) {
            nbytes += (tensor->ne[i] - 1)*tensor->nb[i];
        }
    }
    else {
        nbytes = tensor->ne[0]*tensor->nb[0]/blck_size;
        for (int i = 1; i < GGML_MAX_DIMS; ++i) {
            nbytes += (tensor->ne[i] - 1)*tensor->nb[i];
        }
    }

    return nbytes;
}
```
Now, the tensor a is of type `GGML_TYPE_F32` and it has a block size as follows:
```c
static const ggml_type_traits_t type_traits[GGML_TYPE_COUNT] = {
    ...
    [GGML_TYPE_F32] = {
        .type_name                = "f32",
        .blck_size                = 1,
        .type_size                = sizeof(float),
        .is_quantized             = false,
        .vec_dot                  = (ggml_vec_dot_t) ggml_vec_dot_f32,
        .vec_dot_type             = GGML_TYPE_F32,
        .nrows                    = 1,
    },
    ...
```
I had not reflected over this `.blk_size` before but now noticing that it is
used in `ggml_nbytes`.  And `nbytes` is intialied to the size of the type which
in this case is 4 bytes. Then all the dimensions, currently 4, are iterated over
and nbytes is incremented by the number of elements in the dimension minus 1
times the number of bytes for a stride. This subtraction by one was not obvious
to me at first but what I missed was that we have already accounted for the
initial size of the type when we initialized `nbytes` by calling
`ggml_type_size`:
```c
    if (blck_size == 1) {
  ----> nbytes = ggml_type_size(tensor->type);
        for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_DIMS; ++i) {
            nbytes += (tensor->ne[i] - 1)*tensor->nb[i];
        }
    }
```
Lets take an example, say we have a 1d tensor with 5 elements of type f32. This
will have a `ne[0]=5`, and `nb[0]=4` (the number of bytes for a stride). So the
calculation will be `4*4=16` but since this is += we also include the first 4
bytes.

So after that little detour we are back in `ggml_gallocr_allocate_node`:
```c
        // allocate tensor from the buffer
        struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc = galloc->buf_tallocs[buffer_id];
        ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft = galloc->bufts[buffer_id];
        size_t size = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(buft, node);

---->   size_t offset = ggml_dyn_tallocr_alloc(alloc, size, node);
        hn->buffer_id = buffer_id;
        hn->offset = offset;
        return;
```
```c
static size_t ggml_dyn_tallocr_alloc(struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc, size_t size,
    const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    size = aligned_offset(NULL, size, alloc->alignment);
```
Lets look at `aligned_offset`, and notice that the buffer is set to NULL:
```c
static size_t aligned_offset(const void * buffer, size_t offset, size_t alignment) {
    assert(alignment && !(alignment & (alignment - 1))); // power of 2
    size_t align = (alignment - (((uintptr_t)buffer + offset) % alignment)) % alignment;
    return offset + align;
}
```
When passing in NULL as the buffer the align assignment becomes:
```c
    size_t align = (alignment - offset) % alignment) % alignment;
```
```console
(lldb) p buffer
(const void *) 0x0000000000000000
(lldb) p offset
(size_t) 24
(lldb) p alignment
(size_t) 32
```

What this is doing is that we are asking, if I start at the offset 24 how many
bytes are needed to reach the next aligment boundrary which is 32. 
We can visualize this like this:
```console
0        32        64        96   (byte positions)
|         |         |         |
      |---|
     24   32
     ↑    ↑
     |    |
 offset  next alignment boundry for this offset
 ```
So `align` will be 8 in this case and the returned value will be 24 + 8 = 32.
 ```console
(gdb) p aligned_offset(0x0, 24, 32)
$1 = 32
(lldb) p aligned_offset(0x0, 33, 32)
(size_t) 64
(lldb) p aligned_offset(0x0, 63, 32)
(size_t) 64
(lldb) p aligned_offset(0x0, 65, 32)
(size_t) 96
```

```c
    size_t align = (alignment - (((uintptr_t)buffer + offset) % alignment)) % alignment;
```

So with the aligned size of 32 which is stored in `size` we can move on in the
function:
```c
static size_t ggml_dyn_tallocr_alloc(struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc, size_t size, const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    size = aligned_offset(NULL, size, alloc->alignment);
    size_t max_avail = 0;

    // find the best fitting free block besides the last block
    int best_fit_block = -1;
    size_t best_fit_size = SIZE_MAX;
```
Notice that `best_fit_size` is initialized to `SIZE_MAX`:
```console
(gdb) p best_fit_size
$234 = 18446744073709551615
(gdb) p (int) best_fit_size
$235 = -1
```
Next we have:
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < alloc->n_free_blocks - 1; i++) {
        struct free_block * block = &alloc->free_blocks[i];
        max_avail = MAX(max_avail, block->size);
        if (block->size >= size && block->size <= best_fit_size) {
            best_fit_block = i;
            best_fit_size = block->size;
        }
    }
```
Notice that the above is checking `alloc->n_free_blocks - 1` which is 0 in our
case so this for loop will not be executed in this case.

Instead the following path will be taken as `best_fit_block` was initilized
to MAX_SIZE which is -1:
```c
    if (best_fit_block == -1) {
        // the last block is our last resort
        struct free_block * block = &alloc->free_blocks[alloc->n_free_blocks - 1];
        max_avail = MAX(max_avail, block->size);
        if (block->size >= size) {
            best_fit_block = alloc->n_free_blocks - 1;
        } else {
            // this should never happen
            fprintf(stderr, "%s: not enough space in the buffer to allocate %zu bytes, largest block available %zu bytes\n",
                    __func__, size, max_avail);
            GGML_ABORT("not enough space in the buffer");
        }
    }
```
```console
(gdb) p alloc->n_free_blocks
$237 = 1
(gdb) ptype block

(gdb) ptype block
type = struct free_block {
    size_t offset;
    size_t size;
} *
(gdb) p *block
$238 = {offset = 0, size = 9223372036854775807}
```
So there is only one free block at the moment.
```
block (variable name in code above):

   0                                                                  SIZE_MAX
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |                          Free block                                 |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
   ↑                                                                     ↑
   offset                                                               size
```
So the above is setting `best_fit_block` to 0.
Then we have:
```c
    struct free_block * block = &alloc->free_blocks[best_fit_block];
    size_t offset = block->offset;
    block->offset = offset + size;
    block->size -= size;
```
```
block:

   0       31                                                       SIZE_MAX
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        |                 Free block                                 |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
            ↑                                                     ↑
          offset                                                 size
                                                            (SIZE_MAX - 32)
```

```c
    if (block->size == 0) {
        // remove block if empty
        alloc->n_free_blocks--;
        for (int j = best_fit_block; j < alloc->n_free_blocks; j++) {
            alloc->free_blocks[j] = alloc->free_blocks[j+1];
        }
    }
```
The `best_fit_block` will be set to 0 in this case and the offset of the 
`block` will be set to offset + size (32) and its size set to -33 (notice that
the above is subtracting size from the current blocks size):
```console
(gdb) p *block
$24 = {offset = 32, size = 9223372036854775775}
(gdb) p (int) block.size
$25 = -33
```
The final part of this function (`ggml_dyn_tallocr_alloc`) (skipping the
debugging part for the tensors) is:
```
    alloc->max_size = MAX(alloc->max_size, offset + size);

    return offset;

    GGML_UNUSED(tensor);
}
```
The dynamic tensor allocator's max_size will be updated to 32 above
(offset (0) + size (32)). And then the offset is returned.

The dynamic tensor allocator `max_size` will be updated to 32 and the offset (0)
returned to `ggml_gallocr_allocate_node`:
```c
        hn->buffer_id = buffer_id;
        hn->offset = offset;
        return;
```
`hn` is `hash_node` and will have the buffer id and offset set:
```c
gdb) p galloc->hash_values[2]
$93 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}
```
So the second entry in the `hash_values` array is for tensor `a` which used
buffer 0 and is allocted at offset 0.

This will return back to `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph_impl` where the same will
be done for the `b` tensor which is also a leaf node:
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_leafs; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * leaf = graph->leafs[i];
        ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(galloc, leaf, get_node_buffer_id(leaf_buffer_ids, i));
    }
```
This time through the free block will look something like this:
```console
(gdb) p *block
$267 = {offset = 32, size = 9223372036854775775}
```
```
block:

   0       31                                                       SIZE_MAX
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        |                 Free block                                 |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
            ↑                                                     ↑
          offset                                                 size
                                                            (SIZE_MAX - 32)
```
```c
    struct free_block * block = &alloc->free_blocks[best_fit_block];
    size_t offset = block->offset;
    block->offset = offset + size;
    block->size -= size;
```

```
block:

   0       31         63                                              SIZE_MAX
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        |         |       Free block                                 |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
                      ↑                                   ↑
                     offset                              size
                                                       (SIZE_MAX - 64)
```
And before the offset is returned  `alloc->max_size` will be updated to 64.
One things to keep in mind is that these blocks are used to store tensor data 
and they are referring to offsets and sizes in a backend buffer.

And the size was determined by:
```console
(gdb) p ggml_nbytes(node)
$277 = 8
(gdb) p aligned_offset(0x0, 8, 32)
$283 = 32
```
At this point we have two entries that are poplulated in the `hash_values` array:
```console
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[1]
$115 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, allocated = true}
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[2]
$100 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}

(gdb) p galloc->hash_set.keys[1]->name
$107 = "b", '\000' <repeats 62 times>
(gdb) p galloc->hash_set.keys[2]->name
$108 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>
```
Notice that the hash values offset field is the offset where the block start.

So we can get a node/tensors index using:
```console
(gdb) p node->name
$140 = "b", '\000' <repeats 62 times>

(gdb) p ggml_hash_find(&galloc->hash_set, node)
$139 = 1
```
And we can the look up the hash node using the index:
```console
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[1]
$141 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, allocated = true}
```

So this whole time we've been stepping through `ggml_gallocr_reserve` which
is called from `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph`. 

TODO: Move this somewhere and explain it better. Or remove it?

Following that there will be an iteration over all the nodes in the graph which
in our case is only 1:
```
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = graph->nodes[i];


        if (ggml_is_view(node) && node->op != GGML_OP_NONE) {
            struct ggml_tensor * view_src = node->view_src;
            ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, view_src)->n_views += 1;
        }

        if (node->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_INPUT) {
            ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(galloc, graph->nodes[i], get_node_buffer_id(node_buffer_ids, i));
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_MAX_SRC; j++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * src = node->src[j];
            if (src == NULL) {
                continue;
            }

            ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, src)->n_children += 1;

            // allocate explicit inputs
            if (src->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_INPUT) {
                ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(galloc, src, get_node_buffer_id(node_buffer_ids, i));
            }
        }
    }
```
I need to revisit the first two is statements as I'm not sure what they are
about yet, but this this case we are processing the `result` tensor which is
a mul operation and has `a` and `b` it's parents (srcs).

So this will first call `ggml_galllocr_hash_get` for `a` and we know that `a`
has already been added as we went through the leafs before.
```console
(gdb) p *ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, src)
$148 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}
```
So the above is incrementing/setting the number of children for `a` to 1.  I
believe that this is used for reference counting. Since the `a` tensor is used
by the `result` it is being referenced so the number of children is incremented.
And the same will happen for `b`.


```c
static void ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph_impl(ggml_gallocr_t galloc,
    struct ggml_cgraph * graph, const int * node_buffer_ids, const int * leaf_buffer_ids) {
    ...
    // allocate tensors
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_nodes; i++) {
        ...

        // allocate node
        ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(galloc, node, buffer_id);
}
```
One thing that I missed initially going through this is that this function will
return if it can reuse the parent tensor.
```c
                    } else {
                        AT_PRINTF("reusing parent %s for %s\n", parent->name, node->name);
                        hn->buffer_id = p_hn->buffer_id;
                        hn->offset = p_hn->offset;
                        p_hn->allocated = false; // avoid freeing the parent
                        return;
                    }
```
At this point the leaf nodes have been allocated/processed:
```console
(gdb) p galloc->hash_set.keys[1]->name
$501 = "b", '\000' <repeats 62 times>

(gdb) p *ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, galloc->hash_set->keys[1])
$505 = {n_children = 1, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, allocated = true}

(gdb) p galloc->hash_set.keys[2]->name
$502 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>

(gdb) p *ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, galloc->hash_set->keys[2])
$506 = {n_children = 1, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}
```
There was a previous count of all the nodes and there parents in the computation
graphs and the number of times a tensor is used as a parent(src) was stored in
the `n_children` field of the hash node. So this is the number of times a tensor
is used as a parent in the graph.

And the above will now process the `result` tensor.
```console
(gdb) p galloc->hash_set.keys[0]->name
$508 = "result", '\000' <repeats 57 times>

(gdb) p *ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, galloc->hash_set->keys[0])
$507 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}
```
At this point we have processes the `result` tensor and we will now update the
parents of this tensor.
```c
        // update parents
        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_MAX_SRC; j++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * parent = node->src[j];
            if (parent == NULL) {
                continue;
            }
            struct hash_node * p_hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, parent);
            p_hn->n_children -= 1;
```
This is decrementing the parent hash nodes `n_children` field by 1 which means
that the current node has been allocated and its parent nodes have been
processed as part of that. So this is indicating that the parent tensor is no
longer needed by the current tensor.

Now, after this decrement if the `n_children` field is 0 then the parent tensor
can be freed. Note that for the `a` tensor this will not happen as its allocated
field has set to false in `ggml_gallocr_allocate_node` as part of the reuse 
(in-place optimization):
```c
                        hn->buffer_id = p_hn->buffer_id;
                        hn->offset = p_hn->offset;
                        p_hn->allocated = false; // avoid freeing the parent
                        return;
```
This makes sense because if the `result` tensor wil be using the same memory
block as `a` then we cannot free that block.

So calling `ggml_gallocr_free_node` will not free the `a` tensor. But for tensor
`b` this will free the node:
```c
            if (p_hn->n_children == 0) {
                ggml_gallocr_free_node(galloc, parent);
            }
        }
    }
}
```
```c
    ggml_gallocr_free_node(galloc, parent);
```
```c
static void ggml_gallocr_free_node(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * node) {
    struct hash_node * hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, node);
    size_t offset = hn->offset;
    int buffer_id = hn->buffer_id;
    struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc = galloc->buf_tallocs[buffer_id];
    ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft = galloc->bufts[buffer_id];
    size_t size = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(buft, node);
    ggml_dyn_tallocr_free_tensor(alloc, offset, size, node);
    hn->allocated = false;
}
```
```console
(gdb) p *hn
$529 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, allocated = true}
(gdb) p size
$530 = 8
```

```
block:

   0       31         63                                              SIZE_MAX

                                                       (SIZE_MAX - 64)
```
```c
static void ggml_dyn_tallocr_free_tensor(struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc, size_t offset, size_t size, const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    size = aligned_offset(NULL, size, alloc->alignment);

    // see if we can merge with an existing block
    for (int i = 0; i < alloc->n_free_blocks; i++) {
        struct free_block * block = &alloc->free_blocks[i];
        ...

        // check if ptr is at the beginning of the block
        if (offset + size == block->offset) {
            block->offset = offset;
            block->size += size;
            // check if we can merge with the previous block
            if (i > 0 && alloc->free_blocks[i-1].offset + alloc->free_blocks[i-1].size == block->offset) {
                alloc->free_blocks[i-1].size += block->size;
                alloc->n_free_blocks--;
                for (int j = i; j < alloc->n_free_blocks; j++) {
                    alloc->free_blocks[j] = alloc->free_blocks[j+1];
                }
            }
            return;
        }
    }
```
```console
(gdb) p size
$531 = 32
(gdb) p alloc->n_free_blocks
$532 = 1

(gdb) p *block
$534 = {offset = 64, size = 9223372036854775743}
```
So the block offset will be set to the offset (32) and the size will be
incremented by size (32). This will result in something like this:
```
block:

   0       31         63                                              SIZE_MAX
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
   |        |         |       Free block                                 |
   +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
            ↑                                                      ↑
           offset                                                size
                                                             (old size + 32)
```
The above function will then return. And now the next free block will start
at 32 instead of 64 and available for other tensors to use.
Keep in mind that there was not been any memory allocated yet, this will happen
later when we return to `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph`.  This is only "simulating"
or tracking how memory wil be used to optimize the memory usage. Like the
free block struct only has an offset and a size field and we build up and
array of blocks where tensors are to be allocated later by an actual backend.

Following that we have:
```c
    // allocate tensors
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = graph->nodes[i];
        int buffer_id = get_node_buffer_id(node_buffer_ids, i);

        // allocate parents (only leafs need to be allocated at this point)
        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_MAX_SRC; j++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * parent = node->src[j];
            if (parent == NULL) {
                continue;
            }
            ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(galloc, parent, buffer_id);
        }
```
For the first iteration parent will be node `a` which has already been
allocated. The same will be done for `b` which is also already allocated.

After that we have where node is the `result` node which is a mul operation:
```c
        // allocate node
        ggml_gallocr_allocate_node(galloc, node, buffer_id);
```
```c
    if (!ggml_gallocr_is_allocated(galloc, node) && !ggml_is_view(node)) {
        hn->allocated = true;
        assert(hn->offset == 0);

        // try to reuse a parent's buffer (inplace)
        if (ggml_op_can_inplace(node->op)) {
            for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_SRC; i++) {
                struct ggml_tensor * parent = node->src[i];
                
                // if the node's data is external, then we cannot re-use it
                if (!ggml_gallocr_is_own(galloc, parent)) {
                    AT_PRINTF("not reusing parent %s for %s as %p is external\n", parent->name, node->name, parent->data);
                    continue;
                }

```
This time the tensor is an operation so the above block will be executed and the
parent will be tensor `a` for the first iteration.

This will then call `ggml_gallocr_is_own` which I've not come across before:
```c
static bool ggml_gallocr_is_own(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * t) {
    return ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, t)->allocated;
}
```
I first thought this looked very simliar to `ggml_gallocr_is_allocated` but
that function also checks the tensors data pointer that it is null. This is just
checking the hash node for the tensor has its allocated field set to true.
```console
(gdb) p galloc->hash_values[2]
$167 = {n_children = 1, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}
```
Next there is a check if the `GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_INPUT` flag is set for the
parent:
```c
                // outputs cannot be reused
                if (parent->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_OUTPUT ||
                   (parent->view_src != NULL && parent->view_src->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_OUTPUT)) {
                    AT_PRINTF("not reusing parent %s for %s as it is an output\n", parent->name, node->name);
                    continue;
                }
```
This is not the case for this session.
Next there is the following check:
```c
                if (!ggml_are_same_layout(node, parent)) {
                    AT_PRINTF("not reusing parent %s for %s as layouts are different\n", parent->name, node->name);
                    continue;
                }
```
And to recap what node and parent are:
```console
(gdb) p node->name
$168 = "result", '\000' <repeats 57 times>
(gdb) p parent->name
$169 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>
```
I've not seen `ggml_are_same_layout` before either:
```c
static bool ggml_are_same_layout(const struct ggml_tensor * a, const struct ggml_tensor * b) {
    if (a->type != b->type) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i < GGML_MAX_DIMS; i++) {
        if (a->ne[i] != b->ne[i]) {
            return false;
        }
        if (a->nb[i] != b->nb[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
So this is checking the types are the same, and that the number of elements and
the strides match. This is the case for `a` and `result` so this will return
true. So that warning will not be displayed.

Then we have the following:
```c
    struct hash_node * p_hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, parent);
```
This is passing in parent which is `a` and we know that `a` has already been
added:
```console
(gdb) p *p_hn
$184 = {n_children = 1, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = true}
```
Next the `n_children` field is used which I've been curious about:
```c
                if (p_hn->n_children == 1 && p_hn->n_views == 0) {
                    if (ggml_is_view(parent)) {
                        struct ggml_tensor * view_src = parent->view_src;
                        struct hash_node * view_src_hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, view_src);
                        if (view_src_hn->n_views == 1 && view_src_hn->n_children == 0 && view_src->data == parent->data) {
                            AT_PRINTF("reusing view parent %s (%s) for %s\n", parent->name, view_src->name, node->name);
                            assert(view_src_hn->offset == p_hn->offset);
                            hn->buffer_id = p_hn->buffer_id;
                            hn->offset = p_hn->offset;
                            p_hn->allocated = false; // avoid freeing the parent
                            view_src_hn->allocated = false;
                            return;
                        }
                    } else {
                        AT_PRINTF("reusing parent %s for %s\n", parent->name, node->name);
                        hn->buffer_id = p_hn->buffer_id;
                        hn->offset = p_hn->offset;
                        p_hn->allocated = false; // avoid freeing the parent
                        return;
                    }
                }
```
The else clause will be taken as node a is not a view. Now, `hn` is the hash
node for `result` and `p_hn` is the hash node for `a`. So this is updating
the `result` hash node to have the same buffer id and offset as `a` and then
setting `a`s hash node to not be allocated.
So for the result tensor if we look up the hash node is will now have the same
buffer id and offset as `a`. So result will reuse the buffer of `a`?

This will then return us back to `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph_impl`:
```c
        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_MAX_SRC; j++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * parent = node->src[j];
            if (parent == NULL) {
                continue;
            }
            AT_PRINTF("%s", parent->name);
            if (j < GGML_MAX_SRC - 1 && node->src[j + 1] != NULL) {
                AT_PRINTF(", ");
            }
        }
```
This is just logging so skipping.

Then we have the following which is the last block of this function:
```c
        // update parents
        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_MAX_SRC; j++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * parent = node->src[j];
            if (parent == NULL) {
                continue;
            }
            struct hash_node * p_hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, parent);
            p_hn->n_children -= 1;

            AT_PRINTF("parent %s: %d children, %d views, allocated: %d\n",
                parent->name, p_hn->n_children, p_hn->n_views, p_hn->allocated);

            if (p_hn->n_children == 0 && p_hn->n_views == 0) {
                if (ggml_is_view(parent)) {
                    struct ggml_tensor * view_src = parent->view_src;
                    struct hash_node * view_src_hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, view_src);
                    view_src_hn->n_views -= 1;
                    AT_PRINTF("view_src %s: %d children, %d views\n",
                        view_src->name, view_src_hn->n_children, view_src_hn->n_views);
                    if (view_src_hn->n_views == 0 && view_src_hn->n_children == 0 && view_src_hn->allocated) {
                        ggml_gallocr_free_node(galloc, view_src);
                    }
                }
                else if (p_hn->allocated) {
                    ggml_gallocr_free_node(galloc, parent);
                }
            }
```
This is again iterating over the parents of the `result` tensor. And it will
get the hash node for tensor `a`.
```console
(gdb) p *p_hn
$197 = {n_children = 1, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = false}
```
And it will decrement the number of children for `a` and log the values.
```console
(gdb) p *p_hn
$198 = {n_children = 0, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, allocated = false}
```
The if statement will be entered but the parent is not a view and is no longer
allocated. So this will then continue the loop and process the b parent:
```console
(gdb) p *p_hn
$199 = {n_children = 1, n_views = 0, buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, allocated = true}
```
This hash node will also be decremented, and the if block will be entered. But
this time it is hash node is allocated so `ggml_gallocr_free_node` will be
called:
```c
static void ggml_gallocr_free_node(ggml_gallocr_t galloc, struct ggml_tensor * node) {
    // graph outputs are never freed
    if (node->flags & GGML_TENSOR_FLAG_OUTPUT) {
        AT_PRINTF("not freeing output %s\n", node->name);
        return;
    }

    struct hash_node * hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, node);
    size_t offset = hn->offset;
    int buffer_id = hn->buffer_id;
    struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc = galloc->buf_tallocs[buffer_id];
    ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft = galloc->bufts[buffer_id];
    size_t size = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(buft, node);
    ggml_dyn_tallocr_free_tensor(alloc, offset, size, node);
    hn->allocated = false;
}
```
So lets take a look at what `ggml_dyn_tallocr_free_tensor` does:
```c
static void ggml_dyn_tallocr_free_tensor(struct ggml_dyn_tallocr * alloc,
    size_t offset, size_t size, const struct ggml_tensor * tensor) {
    size = aligned_offset(NULL, size, alloc->alignment);

    ...

        // check if ptr is at the beginning of the block
        if (offset + size == block->offset) {
            block->offset = offset;
            block->size += size;
            // check if we can merge with the previous block
            if (i > 0 && alloc->free_blocks[i-1].offset + alloc->free_blocks[i-1].size == block->offset) {
                alloc->free_blocks[i-1].size += block->size;
                alloc->n_free_blocks--;
                for (int j = i; j < alloc->n_free_blocks; j++) {
                    alloc->free_blocks[j] = alloc->free_blocks[j+1];
                }
            }
            return;
        }
```
I'm just showing the path taken in this case, the following are the values used:
```console
(gdb) p offset
$221 = 32
(gdb) p size
$222 = 32
(gdb) p *block
$226 = {offset = 64, size = 9223372036854775743}
```
So the above code is going to set the blocks offset to 32, and increase its
size by 32.
```console
(gdb) p *block
$227 = {offset = 32, size = 9223372036854775775}
(gdb) p (int) block.size
$228 = -33
```
This will then return control to `ggml_gallocr_reserve_n` where we called:
```c
    // allocate in hash table
->  ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph_impl(galloc, graph, node_buffer_ids, leaf_buffer_ids);

    // set the node_allocs from the hash table
    if (galloc->n_nodes < graph->n_nodes) {
        free(galloc->node_allocs);
        galloc->node_allocs = calloc(graph->n_nodes, sizeof(struct node_alloc));
        GGML_ASSERT(galloc->node_allocs != NULL);
    }
```
This is where the `node_allocs` array is allocated with the number of nodes
in the graphs (1 in our case).

```c
struct node_alloc {
    struct tensor_alloc dst;
    struct tensor_alloc src[GGML_MAX_SRC];
};
```
We can see this struct has two fields, one for the destination tensor and an
array for the source tensors. In our case we have a mul operation which has

```
struct tensor_alloc {
    int buffer_id;
    size_t offset;
    size_t size_max; // 0 = pre-allocated, unused, or view
};
```
TODO: Provide some intuition about these structs and overall about the galloc
struct.

Next, the number of nodes on the galloc struct are set:
```c
    galloc->n_nodes = graph->n_nodes;
```
Then all the nodes will be iterated over and the `node_alloc` entries will be
populated:
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = graph->nodes[i];
        struct node_alloc * node_alloc = &galloc->node_allocs[i];
        if (node->view_src || node->data) {
            node_alloc->dst.buffer_id = -1;
            node_alloc->dst.offset = SIZE_MAX;
            node_alloc->dst.size_max = 0;
        } else {
   --->     struct hash_node * hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, node);
            node_alloc->dst.buffer_id = hn->buffer_id;
            node_alloc->dst.offset    = hn->offset;
            node_alloc->dst.size_max  = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(galloc->bufts[hn->buffer_id], node);
        }
        ...
```
In our case the first else block will be executed, and we are again getting
the hash node by from the hash values (indirectly by getting the index from
the hash set. So for this node we are setting the destination buffer id to the
one from the hash node, likewise with the offset. Notice that the size_max is
set like this:
```c
node_alloc->dst.size_max  = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(galloc->bufts[hn->buffer_id], node);
```
So we can see the buffer id is used to get the buffer type from the array of
buffer types in the galloc struct. Since this is a CPU buffer type this will
default to returning `ggml_nbytes(node)` which is 24 for the `result` tensor.
```console
(gdb) p node_alloc[0].dst
$387 = {buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, size_max = 24}
```

After that all the nodes parents will be iterated over (the a and b tensors):
```c
        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_MAX_SRC; j++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * src = node->src[j];
            if (!src || src->view_src || src->data) {
                node_alloc->src[j].buffer_id = -1;
                node_alloc->src[j].offset = SIZE_MAX;
                node_alloc->src[j].size_max = 0;
            } else {
    ---->       struct hash_node * hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, src);
                node_alloc->src[j].buffer_id = hn->buffer_id;
                node_alloc->src[j].offset   = hn->offset;
                node_alloc->src[j].size_max = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(galloc->bufts[hn->buffer_id], src);
            }
        }
    }
```
Again we are getting the hash node for the source tensor and this time setting
the first src (parent) tensor which is `a` in our case. The buffer id, offset
and size_max are set for this tensor. The same will be done for the second
parent tensor which is `b`.
The remaining node_alloc src entries (there will be 8 more as `GGML_MAX_SRC` is
10) will be set to -1, SIZE_MAX and 0 respectively.

Next, we will do something similar for the leaf nodes. We first allocate the
`leaf_allocs` array with the size of `graph->n_leafs`:
```c
    if (galloc->n_leafs < graph->n_leafs) {
        free(galloc->leaf_allocs);
        galloc->leaf_allocs = calloc(graph->n_leafs, sizeof(galloc->leaf_allocs[0]));
        GGML_ASSERT(galloc->leaf_allocs != NULL);
    }
    galloc->n_leafs = graph->n_leafs;
```
One difference here is hot calloc is called. With the `node_allocs` we used
the struct type to get the size of the struct. Here we are using the first
element of the array to get the size of the array. These are equivalent in this
situation but perhaps one can argue that using the first element might be more
robust if the struct name changes. Perhaps this could be made consistent so both
use the same.

Then all the leaf nodes will be iterated over (a and b):
```c
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_leafs; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * leaf = graph->leafs[i];
        struct hash_node * hn = ggml_gallocr_hash_get(galloc, leaf);
        galloc->leaf_allocs[i].buffer_id = hn->buffer_id;
        if (leaf->view_src || leaf->data) {
            galloc->leaf_allocs[i].leaf.buffer_id = -1;
            galloc->leaf_allocs[i].leaf.offset = SIZE_MAX;
            galloc->leaf_allocs[i].leaf.size_max = 0;
        } else {
            galloc->leaf_allocs[i].leaf.buffer_id = hn->buffer_id;
            galloc->leaf_allocs[i].leaf.offset = hn->offset;
            galloc->leaf_allocs[i].leaf.size_max = ggml_backend_buft_get_alloc_size(galloc->bufts[hn->buffer_id], leaf);
        }
    }
```
And we retrieve the hash node using the leaf tensor and set the buffer id,
offset and size_max for the leaf tensor.

After that we have the following:
```c
    // reallocate buffers if needed
    for (int i = 0; i < galloc->n_buffers; i++) {
        // if the buffer type is used multiple times, we reuse the same buffer
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (galloc->buf_tallocs[j] == galloc->buf_tallocs[i]) {
                galloc->buffers[i] = galloc->buffers[j];
                break;
            }
        }

        size_t cur_size = galloc->buffers[i] ? ggml_backend_buffer_get_size(galloc->buffers[i]) : 0;
        size_t new_size = ggml_dyn_tallocr_max_size(galloc->buf_tallocs[i]);
```
```console
(gdb) p cur_size
$406 = 0
(gdb) p new_size
$407 = 64
```
So the new size we want to allocate is 64 which I'm thinking if for the two
tensors `a` and `b` which are 32 bytes each because of alignment.

```c
        // even if there are no tensors allocated in this buffer, we still need to allocate it to initialize views
        if (new_size > cur_size || galloc->buffers[i] == NULL) {
            fprintf(stderr, "%s: reallocating %s buffer from size %.02f MiB to %.02f MiB\n", __func__, ggml_backend_buft_name(galloc->bufts[i]), cur_size / 1024.0 / 1024.0, new_size / 1024.0 / 1024.0);

            ggml_backend_buffer_free(galloc->buffers[i]);
            galloc->buffers[i] = ggml_backend_buft_alloc_buffer(galloc->bufts[i], new_size);

            if (galloc->buffers[i] == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "%s: failed to allocate %s buffer of size %zu\n", __func__, ggml_backend_buft_name(galloc->bufts[i]), new_size);
                return false;
            }
            ggml_backend_buffer_set_usage(galloc->buffers[i], GGML_BACKEND_BUFFER_USAGE_COMPUTE);
        }
    }

    return true;
```
Before we entry the above section the buffers array of the galloc struct will is:
```console
(gdb) p galloc->buffers[0]
$409 = (ggml_backend_buffer_t) 0x0
```
```c
GGML_CALL ggml_backend_buffer_t ggml_backend_buft_alloc_buffer(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft, size_t size) {
    return buft->iface.alloc_buffer(buft, size);
}
```
Notice that the buffer type is used when we create a buffer.

In our case since we are using a CPU backend type this call will end up in
`ggml-backend.c`:
```c
GGML_CALL static ggml_backend_buffer_t ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_type_alloc_buffer(ggml_backend_buffer_type_t buft, size_t size) {
    size += TENSOR_ALIGNMENT;   // malloc may return an address that is not aligned
    void * data = malloc(size); // TODO: use GGML_ALIGNED_MALLOC (move to ggml-impl.h)
    if (data == NULL) {
        fprintf(stderr, "%s: failed to allocate buffer of size %zu\n", __func__, size);
        return NULL;
    }

    return ggml_backend_buffer_init(buft, cpu_backend_buffer_i, data, size);
}
static const size_t TENSOR_ALIGNMENT = 32; // required for mmap as gguf only guarantees 32-byte alignment
```
With the added alignment the size will then be 96. And this will malloc that
amount of memory and return a pointer to it which is stored in the the `data`
variable. Notice that `data` is passed as the third argument to
`ggml_backend_buffer_init` which is named `context` in the function signature.
So for a CPU backend buffer the context is the pointer to the memory that was
allocated.

Then `ggml_backend_buffer_init` is called to create the backend buffer, and
note that this is passing `cpu_backend_buffer_i` as the backend buffer (iface):
```c
static struct ggml_backend_buffer_i cpu_backend_buffer_i = {
    /* .get_name        = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_name,
    /* .free_buffer     = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_free_buffer,
    /* .get_base        = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_get_base,
    /* .init_tensor     = */ NULL, // no initialization required
    /* .memset_tensor   = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_memset_tensor,
    /* .set_tensor      = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_set_tensor,
    /* .get_tensor      = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_get_tensor,
    /* .cpy_tensor      = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_cpy_tensor,
    /* .clear           = */ ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_clear,
    /* .reset           = */ NULL,
};
```
This will end up in:
```c
GGML_CALL ggml_backend_buffer_t ggml_backend_buffer_init(
               ggml_backend_buffer_type_t      buft,
        struct ggml_backend_buffer_i           iface,
               ggml_backend_buffer_context_t   context,
               size_t                          size) {
    ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer = malloc(sizeof(struct ggml_backend_buffer));

    (*buffer) = (struct ggml_backend_buffer) {
        /* .interface = */ iface,
        /* .buft      = */ buft,
        /* .context   = */ context,
        /* .size      = */ size,
        /* .usage     = */ GGML_BACKEND_BUFFER_USAGE_ANY
    };

    return buffer;
}
```
This return will then return us to.
```c
            galloc->buffers[i] = ggml_backend_buft_alloc_buffer(galloc->bufts[i], new_size);
  --->      if (galloc->buffers[i] == NULL) {
                fprintf(stderr, "%s: failed to allocate %s buffer of size %zu\n", __func__, ggml_backend_buft_name(galloc->bufts[i]), new_size);
                return false;
            }
            ggml_backend_buffer_set_usage(galloc->buffers[i], GGML_BACKEND_BUFFER_USAGE_COMPUTE);
        }
    }

    return true;
```
Then the backend buffer's usage will be set to compute. And then the loop
finishes and the function returns true to `ggml_gallocr_reserve` which will
just return as well to `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph`.
```c
    // reset buffers
    for (int i = 0; i < galloc->n_buffers; i++) {
        if (galloc->buffers[i] != NULL) {
            ggml_backend_buffer_reset(galloc->buffers[i]);
        }
    }
```
This does nothing for the CPU backend because as we can see above the .reset
function is NULL for the `cpu_backend_buffer_i` struct.

Next we have: 
```c
    // allocate the graph tensors from the previous assignments
    // leafs
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_leafs; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * leaf = graph->leafs[i];
        struct leaf_alloc * leaf_alloc = &galloc->leaf_allocs[i];
        ggml_gallocr_init_tensor(galloc, leaf, &leaf_alloc->leaf);
    }
```
So this will start with tensor `a` and call `ggml_gallocr_init_tensor`, and
notice that we are passing in `leaf_alloc->leaf` for this tensor.
```console
(gdb) p leaf->name
$421 = "a", '\000' <repeats 62 times>
(gdb) p *leaf_alloc
$420 = {buffer_id = 0, leaf = {buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, size_max = 24}}
```

So we have a `tensor_alloc` struct which looks like this:
```c
struct tensor_alloc {
    int buffer_id;
    size_t offset;
    size_t size_max; // 0 = pre-allocated, unused, or view
};
```
We have an buffer id which identifies the buffer for this tensor, and the offset
is the offset from that buffers base address. `size_max` I'm not really sure
about yet. Now, a `leaf_alloc` the looks like this, and recall that a leaf does
not have any parents/srcs:
```c
struct leaf_alloc {
    int buffer_id;
    struct tensor_alloc leaf;
};
```
I'm note sure what the reason for having a buffer id in this struct in addition
to the actual leaf tensor's buffer id.

A `node_alloc` is not so different if we ignore the buffer id, but a node can
also have parents:
```c
struct node_alloc {
    struct tensor_alloc dst;
    struct tensor_alloc src[GGML_MAX_SRC];
};
```
TODO: move the above about the alloc structs to some better place.

```c
static void ggml_gallocr_init_tensor(ggml_gallocr_t galloc,
    struct ggml_tensor * tensor, struct tensor_alloc * tensor_alloc) {

    int buffer_id = tensor_alloc->buffer_id;

    if (tensor->view_src != NULL) {
        if (tensor->buffer == NULL) {
            assert(tensor_alloc->offset == SIZE_MAX);
            if (tensor->view_src->buffer == NULL) {
                // this tensor was allocated without ggml-backend
                return;
            }
            ggml_backend_view_init(tensor);
        }
    } else {
 ---->  if (tensor->data == NULL) {
            void * base = ggml_backend_buffer_get_base(galloc->buffers[buffer_id]);
            void * addr = (char *)base + tensor_alloc->offset;
            ggml_backend_tensor_alloc(galloc->buffers[buffer_id], tensor, addr);
        } else {
            if (tensor->buffer == NULL) {
                // this tensor was allocated without ggml-backend
                return;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
So this will first get the base memory address from the backend buffer.
```c
void * ggml_backend_buffer_get_base(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer) {
    void * base = buffer->iface.get_base(buffer);
    return base;
}
```
And for the CPU backend this will look like this:
```c
GGML_CALL static void * ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_get_base(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer) {
    uintptr_t data = (uintptr_t)buffer->context;

    // align the buffer
    if (data % TENSOR_ALIGNMENT != 0) {
        data = GGML_PAD(data, TENSOR_ALIGNMENT);
    }

    return (void *)data;
}
```
Like we mentioned ealier when looking at how the CPU backend buffer was created
we noted that the context passed/used to create the buffer was the memory that
was malloced. So this is casting that void pointer to a `uintptr_t`. In this
case the padding is not performed and the pointer is returned as is which will
become the base pointer. This is then used to calculate the address for
tensor `a` using the `tensor_alloc->offset`. So this is how the `tensor_alloc`
offset can be used. Then the buffer, the tensor and the address are passed to
`ggml_backend_tensor_alloc`:
```c
void ggml_backend_tensor_alloc(ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer, struct ggml_tensor * tensor, void * addr) {
    ... // removed some asserts for brevity
    tensor->buffer = buffer;
    tensor->data = addr;
    ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor(buffer, tensor);
}
```
And here we can see that tensor `a`'s buffer is set to the CPU buffer, and its
data pointer is set to the base + offset address. The
`ggml_backend_buffer_init_tensor` is optional and not implemented for the CPU
backend. 
The same will be done for tensor `b` as well.

Next, the nodes will be iterated which in our case is only one and is the
`result` tensor:
```c
    // nodes
    for (int i = 0; i < graph->n_nodes; i++) {
        struct ggml_tensor * node = graph->nodes[i];
        struct node_alloc * node_alloc = &galloc->node_allocs[i];
        for (int j = 0; j < GGML_MAX_SRC; j++) {
            struct ggml_tensor * src = node->src[j];
            if (src == NULL) {
                continue;
            }
            ggml_gallocr_init_tensor(galloc, src, &node_alloc->src[j]);
        }
        ggml_gallocr_init_tensor(galloc, node, &node_alloc->dst);
    }
```
```console
(gdb) p node_alloc[0].dst
$435 = {buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, size_max = 24}

(gdb) p node_alloc[0].src[0]
$436 = {buffer_id = 0, offset = 0, size_max = 24}

(gdb) p node_alloc[0].src[1]
$437 = {buffer_id = 0, offset = 32, size_max = 8}
```
In this case the src tensor's buffer and data pointer have already been set
which we saw previously. 

After all the src tensors have been processed the current node will be
passed to `ggml_gallocr_init_tensor`. This tensor has not hade its buffer or
data pointers set yet so this will be done now.
After that the function `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph` returns true. And this will
return us to our example.

TODO: Rerun this and document how the galloc struct is connected to everything.
Use the diagram that I started above somewhere.

Next we set the data for the tensors `a` and `b`:
```c
  ggml_backend_tensor_set(a, a_data, 0, ggml_nbytes(a));  
  ggml_backend_tensor_set(b, b_data, 0, ggml_nbytes(b));  
  // For the CPU backend this is pretty much just a memcpy:
  memcpy((char *)b->data + 0, b_data, ggml_nbytes(b));

```

```c
GGML_CALL void ggml_backend_tensor_set(struct ggml_tensor * tensor, const void * data, size_t offset, size_t size) {
    ggml_backend_buffer_t buf = tensor->view_src ? tensor->view_src->buffer : tensor->buffer;

    GGML_ASSERT(buf != NULL && "tensor buffer not set");
    GGML_ASSERT(tensor->data != NULL && "tensor not allocated");
    GGML_ASSERT(offset + size <= ggml_nbytes(tensor) && "tensor write out of bounds");

    if (!size) {
        return;
    }

    buf->iface.set_tensor(buf, tensor, data, offset, size);
}
```
For the CPU backend this will end up in:
```c
GGML_CALL static void ggml_backend_cpu_buffer_set_tensor(
    ggml_backend_buffer_t buffer, struct ggml_tensor * tensor,
    const void * data, size_t offset, size_t size) {

    memcpy((char *)tensor->data + offset, data, size);

    GGML_UNUSED(buffer);
}
```
Then we will call `ggml_backend_graph_compute`:
```c
  ggml_backend_cpu_set_n_threads(backend, 1);
  enum ggml_status st = ggml_backend_graph_compute(backend, c_graph);
```
```c
enum ggml_status ggml_backend_graph_compute(ggml_backend_t backend, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph) {
    enum ggml_status err = ggml_backend_graph_compute_async(backend, cgraph);
    ggml_backend_synchronize(backend);
    return err;
}

enum ggml_status ggml_backend_graph_compute_async(ggml_backend_t backend, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph) {
    return backend->iface.graph_compute(backend, cgraph);
}
```
Interesting to see where that each backend has it's own graph compute
implementation. For the CPU backend it looks like this:
```c
GGML_CALL static enum ggml_status ggml_backend_cpu_graph_compute(ggml_backend_t backend, struct ggml_cgraph * cgraph) {
    struct ggml_backend_cpu_context * cpu_ctx = (struct ggml_backend_cpu_context *)backend->context;

    struct ggml_cplan cplan = ggml_graph_plan(cgraph, cpu_ctx->n_threads, cpu_ctx->threadpool);

    if (cpu_ctx->work_size < cplan.work_size) {
        free(cpu_ctx->work_data);
        cpu_ctx->work_data = malloc(cplan.work_size);
        if (cpu_ctx->work_data == NULL) {
            cpu_ctx->work_size = 0;
            return GGML_STATUS_ALLOC_FAILED;
        }
        cpu_ctx->work_size = cplan.work_size;
    }
    cplan.work_data = cpu_ctx->work_data;

    cplan.abort_callback      = cpu_ctx->abort_callback;
    cplan.abort_callback_data = cpu_ctx->abort_callback_data;

    return ggml_graph_compute(cgraph, &cplan);
}
```
The context looks like this:
```console
(gdb) p *cpu_ctx
$445 = {n_threads = 1, threadpool = 0x0, work_data = 0x0, work_size = 0,
abort_callback = 0x0, abort_callback_data = 0x0}
```
This looks pretty simliar to what I've been doing in examples but not using
a backend and `ggml_graph_compute` is something I've gone over in the past.

So it seems to me that `ggml_gallocr_alloc_graph(galloc, c_graph)` is what will
set up computation graph is an optimized way got be run on a specific backend
type.

#### GGML_LLAMAFILE
This is an build flag that is named `GGML_LLAMAFILE` which is related to the
cpu backend. It is a small optimized BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms)
implementation originally written by Justine Tunney for
[llamafile](https://github.com/mozilla-Ocho/llamafile).  This was contributed in
https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/6414.

There is a blog post about this here:
https://justine.lol/matmul/

We can see that this is used in the CPU backend in `src/ggml-cpu/CMakeLists.txt`:
```console
if (GGML_LLAMAFILE)
    message(STATUS "Using llamafile")

    add_compile_definitions(GGML_USE_LLAMAFILE)

    target_sources(ggml-cpu PRIVATE
                    llamafile/sgemm.cpp
                    llamafile/sgemm.h)
endif()
```
The header includes one function with is a single precision general matrix
multiplication:
```c
bool llamafile_sgemm(int64_t, int64_t, int64_t, const void *, int64_t,
                     const void *, int64_t, void *, int64_t, int, int,
                     int, int, int);
```
Compared to a GEMM function this uses single precision floats which makes it
faster but less percise. This is later used in `ggml_compute_forward_mul_mat`.
