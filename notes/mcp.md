## Model Context Protocol (MCP)
TODO: Add introduction to MCP.

### Whisper MCP exploration
To learn the Model Context Protocol (MCP) I've made an attempt to implement a
stdio server for whisper.cpp in this
[pull request](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp/pull/3321), and a description
of the example can be found [here](https://github.com/ggml-org/whisper.cpp/blob/f27ace4176e2e277a6f8e4e6402c9c46711fd017/examples/mcp/README.md#whispercppexamplesmcp).
