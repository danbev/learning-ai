## Debugging/troubleshooting
Debugging and troubleshooting tips for llama.cpp and ggml.

### Graph execution
It can sometimes be misleading to name tensors and then after the compution try
to see what the values were for each tensor in the graph. This is because the
graph scheduler can sometimes optimize the graph and resuse some of the tensors
for different operations. What an be done instead is create a copy of the
tensor we are interested in and then inspect it. For example:
```c++
        struct ggml_tensor * mul_copy = ggml_mul(ctx0, cur, layer.norm_in_w);
        ggml_format_name(mul, "layernorm_mul_copy-%ld", il);
        ggml_build_forward_expand(gf, mul_copy);
```
And then in some other part of the code we can inspect the tensor:
```c++
    {
        struct ggml_tensor* next_out = ggml_graph_get_tensor(gf, "layernorm_mul_copy-0");
        float next_buffer[10];
        ggml_backend_t next_bk = ggml_backend_sched_get_tensor_backend(ctx.sched, next_out);
        printf("Backend type: %s\n", ggml_backend_name(next_bk));
        printf("Tensor type: %s\n", ggml_type_name(next_out->type));
        ggml_backend_tensor_get_async(next_bk, next_out, next_buffer, 0, sizeof(next_buffer));
        ggml_backend_sched_synchronize(ctx.sched);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            printf("layernorm_mul_copy-0[%d] = %f (isnan=%d)\n", i, next_buffer[i], std::isnan(next_buffer[i]));
        }
    }
```


### Storing and comparing tenors
I've run into situations where I print out say the first 10 value of a tensor
but it can be tricky sometime that the actual type of the data are getting
printed correctly. Instead we can save the tensor to a file and then compare
it with a known good tensor. The use case I had was I was trying to compare
a model that worked in ollama but did not work in llama.cpp:
```c++
void save_tensor_binary(const char* filename, struct ggml_tensor* tensor, ggml_backend_sched_t sched) {
    size_t nbytes = ggml_nbytes(tensor);
    std::vector<uint8_t> buf(nbytes);

    // Get backend for tensor
    ggml_backend_t backend = ggml_backend_sched_get_tensor_backend(sched, tensor);

    // Get raw tensor data
    ggml_backend_tensor_get_async(backend, tensor, buf.data(), 0, nbytes);
    ggml_backend_sched_synchronize(sched);  // Make sure async operation completes

    // Write to binary file
    std::ofstream outfile(filename, std::ios::out | std::ios::binary);
    if (!outfile) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Failed to open file %s for writing\n", filename);
        return;
    }

    outfile.write(reinterpret_cast<const char*>(buf.data()), nbytes);
    outfile.close();
}
```
The we can store tensors using:
```c++
save_tensor_binary("llama_inp_raw.bin", tensor, ctx.sched); 
```

And with two files we can use a tool like cmp:
```console

```
